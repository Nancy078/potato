Any other -</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Good to knows?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Good to knows. (Laughs)</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. Uh, some of it\u2019s style. Okay?  So, my sense is, you know, there\u2019s a number of us doctors who are appointed patients under the study, and the study allows a lot of wiggle room, uh, for how we approach it. Uh. It\u2019s a little concern of mine that all of us could do a little bit differently. But, you know, there\u2019s general consistency about how to do it. So, for me, it\u2019s a style that, uh, giving hormones and chemo together, uh, you can really drop your counts out if you haven\u2019t given it a little bit of space. So, one of the other doctors just gives a lower dose of the chemo, and, uh, like, like, okay, but I would rather make sure you get a full dose of chemo, a full dose of hormones, and if I just space it out a little bit, then we can probably keep that safe.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, space it out a little bit, and I grabbed the number third of January, just outta the air.
