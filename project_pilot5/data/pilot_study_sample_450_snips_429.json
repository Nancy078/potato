Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person’s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don’t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you’re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today.

Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don’t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide.

Huh, you aren’t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don’t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can’t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.

And, um, so often, and often would mean almost nightly, I am rubbing him with either Salonpas or Aspercreme or Bengay, one of the three, on his back, shoulders, legs, so that he can feel comfortable enough so he can lay down and rest. So, you know, that’s how I see it. I don’t know if he feels, if maybe I’m interpreting his pain to be more than it is, but when he asks me to rub, you know, rub something on his back, in my mind it’s pain. When I look at his face, I see that he’s in pain. So that’s what I see. And, you know, it might be that he’s like no, P___, it’s not that bad. On a scale of one to ten, it might be seven, but when I look at him, I’m seeing eight, nine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We’ve got a thing to keep in mind is in your case we decided to try this study because of the genetic mutations that your tumor had.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it wasn’t that we tried this study because you had exhausted all other options.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the reason we’re saying that is because there are other things out there that your cancer has a good chance of responding well to. For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there’s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it’s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it’s similarly related to that drug, but that’s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet. So knowing that, um, from my perspective, like I’m going to be a little less sort of heroic and like waiting to see if this is going to work or not. Because it’s not like you’ve run out of options, and this is the last thing we’re going to try anyway. You know?  There are other options out there. Because we do have those options, yes, one of them is a chemo. Um, we also don’t want this cancer to advance too quickly that we miss the window and you get too sick and too frail, you know, to be able to tolerate those other therapies.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that, that is also in the back of my mind. And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy. Of course, that would be through K___ because that would be standard therapy. Um, so that’s what the other part of my thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay. And, and from my perspective, I didn’t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason. I came here for a consultation because I wasn’t comfortable, uh, with the options that I believe K___ was offering. I came initially for that reason. It’s strange that it was my dentist, so we talk about a lot. It’s strange how you get into certain things, uh, by having relationships with people who have gone through it. My dentist had, uh, numerous family members, had dealt with cancer, and he had recommended, he said, you know what, D___, this is what you need to do. You need to go to one of the teaching hospitals either here in DC you can go to J___ H___, in B___, and from my perspective, there are enough individuals that have come to J___ H___, that are close friends of mine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That said, they shared with me that, uh, if you have a choice, go to J___ H___. So when I came up, my thing was the consultation. We had the consultation. I left, and, uh, and I didn’t say anything. But there was a follow-up that was set for J___ H___. And we sat down, and we talked about this. So we have all these options here. We did the genetic testing. And I said, okay, this is an option just like anything else.

We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn’t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It’s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that’s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that’s kind of would be the next treatment that’s standard treatment. It’s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they’re called “PARP” inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations. And, they found that none of the people without the mutations responded. Fourteen of the sixteen - so, you know, ninety percent who had a mutation responded to these drugs very well. Suggesting, they’re probably going to work really well in patients like that. Um.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Am I one of those people?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, you’re one of those people. Now, that drug hasn’t been through the big paces of FDA trial approval. That’s where it is right now. So, the trials we’re looking at are looking at giving that drug alone or in combination with these standard hormones. So, the trial that I would consider for you have multiple arms. We could talk about that in detail, but, it’s there’s two different trials they could either combine the drugs or give you one drug. Um.

Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga. But the other reason was a tendency of less fatigue with the Zytiga than the Xtandi, in my experience.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Both drugs can cause fatigue. But it seems to be more common and often a little bit worse with Xtandi. So, uh, in my choosing those two, I have been choosing Zytiga, just for that reason. Uh, but the Xtandi is a little bit easier, because you just have to take Xtandi. You don’t have to take another drug.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Why are you taking prednisone with it?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the Zytiga, so the way Xtandi works is, if you think that we talked before about the, the testosterone has to get into the cell and do stuff. It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can’t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there’s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there’s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv1016_1-snip11", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So I all need to do now is go back to the lab and do…</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, no you’re probably gonna stay here and S__ will take you over because those are special tubes that she has to send out and all that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And would it be possible for me to have copies of that stuff?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah I thought you might I know you usually want some.

You obviously just got the radiation to there but if you know you’re a baby, for example, and you had a really tiny spinal cord, and you have this cancer next to it, a proton would be the perfect treatment. For adults, it’s a little harder to know what is better than the standard. So you know you hope maybe if you got protons you wouldn’t have had so many side effects. That’s possible. But it’s not as mainstream I think as we’d like to see it. At some point now when they’re really up and running and more patients will get experience, we’ll probably get a better sense of that.

And that data doesn’t show it to be better necessarily. So it’s a big fight between the radiation guys. They’re trying to figure that out themselves. Um, but I don’t know.

And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill.

The blood cell or the white counts, etc.?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, I mean, so chemotherapy certainly can drop your blood counts and put you at risk for infection.

One might be the vaccine trial which is basically getting your own blood cells to wake up and try to kill the cancer yourself because right now it’s kind of sleeping on the job Mr. S____. You have cancer and your immune cells are like ho-hum, nothing’s happening. It’s still letting the cancer do what it wants so that’s an FDA approved treatment.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No cure but we have some long-term survival benefits so that’s one option. The other option is a different type of chemo so a cousin of the chemo that you had earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The third one is a pill um and it’s a like a super hormone pill that complements what’s going on with your Lupron injections that oh, you love so much.
