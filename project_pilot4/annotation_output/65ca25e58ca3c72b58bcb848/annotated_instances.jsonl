The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you\u2019re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later.

One might be the vaccine trial which is basically getting your own blood cells to wake up and try to kill the cancer yourself because right now it\u2019s kind of sleeping on the job Mr. S____. You have cancer and your immune cells are like ho-hum, nothing\u2019s happening.

I could pick one off the shelf and we\u2019d be good to go</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and you know, depending on what your scans show, I actually would favor Provenge, which is the vaccine therapy, because it\u2019s almost like a flu shot. We don\u2019t really know what happens to the PSA but we do know that if you get it in people who get it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Is that a shot or is that through?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, here\u2019s where it gets a little complicated. You know, the flu shot is also like a vaccine. That, you know, you just get here. But, in cancer it\u2019s a little bit more complicated. So, what we would do is actually send you to the Red Cross right across the street.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They hook you up to a machine and then they take out your cells so they\u2019re not using my cells or anybody else\u2019s cells. They\u2019re taking out your cells, your immune cells so that when they take it they ship it to Atlanta so if you\u2019ve never been to Atlanta, your cells will be. They wake it up and then they ship it back to me, the like better version of you and then I reinfuse it back to you so that your cells know to find the cancer. That\u2019s the thought of how that medicine works. So, we do that, let\u2019s say the Red Cross on a Monday, I get your stuff back like on a Thursday and then I reinfuse it to you on a Thursday. We do that 3 times and then the treatment is done. It\u2019s self-limited. Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So, that\u2019s your immune system.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "moderately", "pos_info": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 55s "}}
