So, uh, uh, one of the best sleeping place, and I hate to say it, is my living room downstairs on the couch. I prop the pillows up, and, uh, and got my favorite space, so when I lay down and put my back up right up against the back of it, but I don\u2019t want to be in the business of sleeping on my living room couch every night, either. We have a sleep number bed that we purchased just for this, but, uh, uh, I wouldn\u2019t recommend sleep number being if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going, you\u2019re going to use it for, because it\u2019s not all it\u2019s, it\u2019s cut out to be.
