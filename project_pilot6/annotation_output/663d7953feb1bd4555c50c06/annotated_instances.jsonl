Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you\u2019re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later. You know, having talked to you before. I think what we should maybe try and do first is see if you'd be eligible and if you have this genotype for the MAP study.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "very", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_empathetic": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}

And uh I I\u2019m gonna be getting it from Midtown rather from here and they\u2019ll know that?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh well once \u2013 what I was going to propose is that I give you the copy of the consent. If you want you can read it and uh if you\u2019re ready to sign today you can, or we can schedule all the testing in anticipation of putting you on the study and all of that downtown and then that same day you can come in and sign the consent and do all the testing necessary. That gives you some time to think it over talk it over before signing.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And you said it would just be a couple days I\u2019d have to be there?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The two days are the long days.

So it\u2019s an earlier setting like I said the combination really we don\u2019t have a good handle on what to expect in terms of toxicities, what dose, etc. So one of the side effects that has been noted so far is that the platelets can drop with this medication. So that is something of course the blood counts will be monitored anyway. Besides that kidney function, liver function, all that will also be monitored and checked. You go \u2013 undergo EKG monitoring that will be hard test like and echo before you start. So there is a lot of components. One additional component is that you probably will need to do a biopsy again as part of the study.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that\u2019s something to think about before you say yes or no.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And does platelets dropping how would that affect me physically?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well if it gets really low then it can cause bleeding and things like that -</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "extremely", "pos_warm": "very", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
