But I still think you need to be careful and pay attention to this.  Okay?  Because if something goes really bad with this \u2013 let\u2019s say you get a bad pneumonia, and we want to put you on a breathing machine even though the steroids may be able to bring you back, we don\u2019t know that.  But if it gets to a point, you know, I\u2019m not sure you really should be on a breathing machine.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And some folks \u2013 most people recover.  Uh, but we have to hold the drugs, not hold the drugs, and then, -- yeah, so it\u2019s a catch twenty-two, uh, that, you know, it also is for individuals like you who again have some factor that tells us that your cancer is not gonna bode well with, you know, your survival from this cancer is not, you know, tremendously long.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I, I was told I\u2019ll see another Christmas.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah.  That could be true, or it could be a little bit longer.  But, again, most of the time when we\u2019ve used the docetaxel \u2013 the Taxotere that you got that you started in the fall?  Uh.  We tell folks that from that setting, we sort of says that people live fifteen to twenty months.  Eh, so that\u2019s when we may get to the end of this year.  Uh.  And so that\u2019s where you also may step back and say, \u201cWhoa.  If time is short, I don\u2019t want to be sick.  I don\u2019t want to have to go to the doctor.  I don\u2019t wanna be all of this other stuff.  Uh.  Let me focus on me.\u201d  Okay?  And work on just keeping you comfortable.  \u2018Cuz right now, you\u2019re comin\u2019 and goin\u2019, gettin\u2019 exhausted at five o\u2019clock.  You\u2019re takin\u2019 your nap and \u2013 you know, getting your cleaning done the next day.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Five. Yeah.  So.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, that is \u2013 some people do just sort of say, \u201cLook.  You know, I\u2019ve been through everything, and I don\u2019t know if I can do much more.  And I wanna just sort of be comfortable.\u201d  Other folks say, \u201cOkay.  There\u2019s more drugs?  Give \u2018em to me.\u201d  Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Chemo is the only thing that we know right now \u2013 the one that your doctor said may not do a whole lot \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have much faith in it is what I think what you told me.  Is again, we do know that if you get the drug, tolerate the drug, respond to the drug, people live longer, but again, that\u2019s got an if, if, if.  Um.  So, that would be what usual is, and then this is research, experimental.  Would require you coming down here every other week for a couple of weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Ah huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, and then, uh, every two weeks, three weeks, once you get past the first part, you\u2019re here a lot \u2013 so that\u2019s for us to watch you, keep close eye on you as well as to see what the side effects are.  Uh.  But for you, it\u2019s a downside of coming a distance, coming here a lot, feeling tired, feeling fatigued, and with the uncertainty is this going to do anything?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right. (Pause)</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But again, if you\u2019re driving, folks driving, getting you here, and again you can go out of this world sayin\u2019, \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything \u2018till the end.\u201d  Okay?
