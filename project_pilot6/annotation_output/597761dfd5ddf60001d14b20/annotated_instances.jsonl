So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It\u2019s called G__?___. And this second drug has been shown in the laboratory, not yet in patients but in the laboratory, that makes the Xtandi work better and longer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And one of the things that this drug does, although it does many other things as well, is that it can boost the immune system. So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person\u2019s body, is because the immune system isn\u2019t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi. Now, I didn\u2019t mention this before but this medication is also a pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So it\u2019s a question of taking two pills versus one pill.

Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it\u2019s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you get it for two shots and then you stop.

So I need to dig into the group that\u2019s testing and find out are you one of those guys that was positive?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: If you were positive, that would mean pretty strongly that we shouldn\u2019t try more hormone treatments. You need to be positive for that to go on this immune trial.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh they\u2019re looking for folks who might have more aggressive hormone insensitive cases. So I\u2019m, I\u2019m going to do that this week just to find out.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh so I think that\u2019s a trial. Uh I\u2019m trying to think. I mean, we, we had a, I\u2019m just thinking of one of the study nurses. There\u2019s also some evidence that folks who uh have been on enzalutamide like you are, there was a group that started giving people immune therapy with enzalutamide, even though the enzalutamide was not working.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They kept them on the enzalutamide and added this immune drug.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And they had occasional patients who have very dramatic effects. Uh probably about twenty-five percent of the patients they treat. So we have a trial. I\u2019ve got to figure out if we can finesse it because you\u2019re not on enzalutamide any more.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "very", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "not at all", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}

I mean, do they consider you a risk?  Are you --</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don\u2019t know. Um, you, you, they\u2019re going to need to talk with their doctors. I do know that the test we did, I think, allows, if we, a discounted test, I\u2019ll find out --- for family members, um, to test as well. Um, there is just a test for BRCA, and then there\u2019s a, you know, at this point these tests are, cover about thirty different genes. Um. That\u2019s the only one they found. So, for your family, I think it, it requires a discussion about it, and then they should \u2013 you know, they need to make a decision if they want to get tested or not. Um.

Who cares about the cost for Christ\u2019s sake?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Well, no, I mean, but she has good medical care.
