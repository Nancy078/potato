Like the night before I didn\u2019t wake up until like four and then some nights it might be every two hours or couple of hours.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: hm mmm, yep, yeah, Do you feel like you empty when you pee</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: or do you feel there\u2019s a little more in there?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: There\u2019s more because you go ahead and pee the full stream then you stop then you, it\u2019s bogged down.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yep, Yep, So, do me a favor. Like after seven p.m. at night don\u2019t drink fluid;</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: don\u2019t drink water, don\u2019t drink tea, don\u2019t drink coffee, don\u2019t drink juice, don\u2019t drink milk, don\u2019t drink anything. After dinner, just done. One, that will allow you to sleep because I think your prostate is acting up, it\u2019s too big which means it\u2019s blocking the way of the pee and then what happens is you pee but there\u2019s stuff left over but your body doesn\u2019t know it until just a little bit more accumulates in there and also your bladder is like oh, I was this full and now I\u2019m this full, okay, I got to pee again and when you\u2019re laying down you pee a lot easier because then your whole body is trying to recalibrate and what\u2019s happening. So, at that point you got to pee some more. So, if you give it less reason to pee which means you don\u2019t have enough fluid on board then you won\u2019t pee because there\u2019s not fluid to put through. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, you do me a favor and do that. I\u2019ll work on getting your CAT scan and your bone scan set up and then we\u2019ll figure out the next step. My thinking is that it probably - I\u2019m going to shoot for the ah vaccine because once that\u2019s done we don\u2019t go back to it and then we just sort of put that and say done and then we move on to the other stuff. What do you think of that?
