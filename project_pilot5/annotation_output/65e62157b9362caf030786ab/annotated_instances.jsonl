Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person\u2019s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don\u2019t change therapy based on PSA.

Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don\u2019t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide.
