Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it\u2019s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you get it for two shots and then you stop. What this medicine does is it makes your testosterone levels go to zero. So it works on your testicles which produce the testosterone and it makes them stop producing testosterone. So people have like menopause type symptoms. Mm?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So you\u2019re going to use Lupron?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes, exactly.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span>"}, "conv5032_1-snip1": {"id": "conv5032_1-snip1", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right, right, right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So um I I think the time has come uh to uh stop this study and potentially switch gears.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um there\u2019s two primary reasons for that.

So the trial was designed in such a way that it was built with a safety check.
