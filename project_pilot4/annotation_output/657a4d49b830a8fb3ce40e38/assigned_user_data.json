So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there\u2019s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you\u2019re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I\u2019ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I\u2019ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One, one to three years, maybe, let\u2019s say.
