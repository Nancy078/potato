You couldn\u2019t do anything!  You\u2019d just be soiling yourself constantly!

Listen.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But I also know that that\u2019s not something you would do proactively because the thought of having a bag scares the heck out of you. I know that. I got it. And now I just threw in two possible bags that\u2019s even more frightening. So, I need you to focus on what we have to do next.
