I was thinking the same thing.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So they will ask you then at our pharmacy, well, can you afford that amount of money, and if you can\u2019t, so they will work to see if there\u2019s grants to see whether they can, the drug companies who make these drugs, can cover the cost that you can\u2019t cover. Okay?  But you have to have Medicare D and all these other things. So it can take a little bit while depending on if they have it.

Although for you, the downsides of it is potentially, you know, fluid retention. Huh, there is a lot of fatigue related to it. Huh, huh, we have to watch your blood tests a little bit. Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person\u2019s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don\u2019t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you\u2019re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, what would you recommend right now?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I, I like the abiraterone but we\u2019ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn\u2019t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I\u2019m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don\u2019t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don\u2019t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don\u2019t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren\u2019t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don\u2019t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can\u2019t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.

So now the question is, you started your hormone shot back up, and you\u2019ve kind of been on it the whole time. It\u2019s just you were delayed a little bit on one day, one of them, and now it\u2019s you need another medicine.

Uh, they\u2019re four pills once a day, and their primary goal of how they work is it\u2019s, it\u2019s like a big hormone pill again. So it\u2019s to help your shot work better. It also is approved by the FDA because it helps you live longer. No cures. Same as we were before but we need to get a handle on all these things in the lung. In the same way, you\u2019re also a candidate for chemo to tell you the truth. Uh, so chemo\u2019s in the mix as well, but the majority of folks I think, and I\u2019m not saying you do, but my patients tend to prefer pills before going on to chemotherapy, and I think way back when we initially again reconnected you were not in so much favor of chemo, uh, as he\u2019s already shaking his head, but I want to bring that up again because at some point we may need to go to chemo. So I want to put that out there still.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but we do have a set of pills. Now, the good news is every time there\u2019s an approved medication, you know, we\u2019re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you\u2019d respond better. So I like that study because it\u2019s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you\u2019re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense or if you\u2019ve got questions with that, but we\u2019re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that\u2019s in the works for us to consider. The other part is either way, however we move forward, there\u2019s another study, which is a registry study, called, Iron Man. Uh, not that you become iron man-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that all your experiences as to what\u2019s happened to you get captured. And that means you write out and answer questionnaires. I write out and answer questionnaires. Uh, and then about once a year we take some blood to see what\u2019s happening uh in terms of new research. Uh, and that participation\u2019s pretty cool because a lot of other men around the world are, are participating. And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone\u2019s experience will be captured. And they\u2019re all like you, in the same boat. So we hope you consider that as well. Uh, but I think what we might do is workup to make sure that you\u2019re eligible for all that stuff. I want to introduce you to M___, who\u2019s our research nurse, uh, who just wants to say hi, and then I think we\u2019ll have you come back in a couple weeks when you feel like you\u2019re a little bit stronger.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "extremely", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_competence": "extremely", "pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "extremely", "pos_empathetic": "extremely", "pos_warm": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}

So it\u2019s an earlier setting like I said the combination really we don\u2019t have a good handle on what to expect in terms of toxicities, what dose, etc. So one of the side effects that has been noted so far is that the platelets can drop with this medication. So that is something of course the blood counts will be monitored anyway. Besides that kidney function, liver function, all that will also be monitored and checked. You go \u2013 undergo EKG monitoring that will be hard test like and echo before you start. So there is a lot of components.

Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Does he go in for another blood transfusion or are you expecting the hemoglobin to increase pretty much on its own as he regulates without the medication?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One idea would be to check a hemoglobin level at a local laboratory, uh, one week from now just to see where we are at. And if it has made significant progress on its own, we can skip the blood transfusion. And if it looks like it\u2019s only gone up like one-tenth of a point, then we can perhaps schedule a blood transfusion before September fifth.
