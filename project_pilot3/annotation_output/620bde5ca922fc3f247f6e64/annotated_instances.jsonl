The immune therapy story is an earlier - it\u2019s still in it\u2019s earlier phases, but people are starting to think, if you have these mutations, you\u2019re making abnormal things on the - in the cell, and that might \u2013 and that\u2019s what kind of gets the immune system excited, something that looks weird. And, maybe you would respond better \u2013 \u2018cuz right now when we give these new immune drugs, they work really well for some cancers Kidney cancer, melanoma, lung cancer. They don\u2019t work very well for prostate cancer in just the general population.

What we were \u2013 I told you about this study we\u2019re trying to do which is, we had two men who got one of our testosterone studies, responded, stayed on the drug for about a year, came off the drug, got some other things, and then got an immune therapy trial, with the expectation that the, uh, the immune therapy doesn\u2019t work really well. But, both of those guys had unbelievable response; a ninety-nine percent drop in their PSA, disease disappeared. So, we\u2019re not exactly sure, but what they both had in common was that they got testosterone. So, our, our, one of our trials is looking at that combination. Does the testosterone change the cell surface or whatever?

So with that rise, I got a little worried. Because I don't want the Xtandi to get away from us. At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board. You still with me?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: No, you gotta slow down.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Do you want me to say it again?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Try me again.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, no worries.

So, sometimes the cancer gets smart. And now we say look, maybe there's a way to kind of flap that, see if we can get it to work again, because it did work for a while, which was good. So this pill going right along, we want to add a second pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This study is to add a second pill, different pathway, to say hey, I'm gonna see if I add the second guy whether both together will make your PSA drop. But of course, to make things complicated, the second pill, they want to do stuff too. So they're going to have two groups. So if you're in the first group, you keep going on your Xtandi, and you get the second pill at a particular dose, no problem. Then W____ is on the same study, he's on Xtandi two pills a day. And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill. But his is not an active 40 milligrams, he just gets the sugar version of the 40 milligrams.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "not at all", "pos_support": "slightly", "pos_info": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 14s "}}

Because more than three then we feel it\u2019s beyond the scope of this trial, it also becomes um less feasible and less practical to target five, six, seven spots.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So at the beginning of the trial you\u2019ll do that scan and that will determine whether I\u2019ll stay in the trial if it\u2019s three or less?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I believe that the PSMA Pet scan is optional. It\u2019s something that they will discuss with you-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and you may opt out. For example, if you had say I just want to focus on treating that area let\u2019s just do it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: now one of the things that about the trial is that it\u2019s randomized.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um, hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: What does a randomized trial mean and in this particular case what are people are being randomized too.
