I mean, the assumption is that it is prostate cancer. Why give him a second cancer?  Uh. So, that\u2019s the assumption. You know, the adrenal gland can have benign tumors in it. Okay?  Um. You know, if prostate cancer went in there, that would be a possible reason why it would bleed. Um. Sometimes the adrenal gland just doesn\u2019t get a good blood supply, and it does bleed.
