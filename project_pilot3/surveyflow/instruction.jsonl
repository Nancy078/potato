{"id":"1","text":"Instructions:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["This project aims to understand how people perceive doctor’s communication during their interactions with patients. You will see short snippets from various conversations between doctors and patients. You will be asked to rate how you feel about the doctor’s communication on several scales (e.g., respectfulness). In each conversation, the patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer and the doctor talks to him about his treatments. The doctor might talk about: the patient's health condition, a new trial or treatment, his eligibility to enroll in the trial, and the doctor’s recommendations. The conversation may include dialogue between doctors and family members/healthcare workers, but our focus is on the doctor.<br></br>  <br>Imagine you’re the patient in each snippet. From your perspective as the patient, you will rate the doctor’s qualities based on what the doctor says in each snippet. (For instance, based on the doctor’s behavior, do you think the doctor regards you, the patient, as a good communicator? ). You should rate based on the doctor’s general tone. In the rare case where you can’t judge one of the qualities, you can put “can’t tell”. Please rate these based on your understanding of the qualities. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move backward and forward. For best viewing experience, please maximize your browser window to full screen. </br>"]}
