Okay?  So you can get a pneumonia that\u2019s from your immune system.  You can get hepatitis because it\u2019s attacking your liver.  You could get colitis \u2018cuz it\u2019s attacking your colon.  Uh, it usually picks one organ, not not all of \u2018em, but, you know, you can get into trouble because your immune system \u2013 while it\u2019s tryin\u2019 to fight your cancer, it\u2019s tryin\u2019 to fight you.
