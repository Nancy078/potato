Now, the good news is every time there\u2019s an approved medication, you know, we\u2019re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you\u2019d respond better. So I like that study because it\u2019s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you\u2019re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense or if you\u2019ve got questions with that, but we\u2019re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that\u2019s in the works for us to consider.

Uh, not that you become iron man-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that all your experiences as to what\u2019s happened to you get captured.

Uh, and then about once a year we take some blood to see what\u2019s happening uh in terms of new research. Uh, and that participation\u2019s pretty cool because a lot of other men around the world are, are participating. And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone\u2019s experience will be captured. And they\u2019re all like you, in the same boat. So we hope you consider that as well. Uh, but I think what we might do is workup to make sure that you\u2019re eligible for all that stuff. I want to introduce you to M___, who\u2019s our research nurse, uh, who just wants to say hi, and then I think we\u2019ll have you come back in a couple weeks when you feel like you\u2019re a little bit stronger.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: How, how long have you been home now?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Two days or-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three days.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: From S___\u2019s.

It also is approved by the FDA because it helps you live longer. No cures. Same as we were before but we need to get a handle on all these things in the lung. In the same way, you\u2019re also a candidate for chemo to tell you the truth. Uh, so chemo\u2019s in the mix as well, but the majority of folks I think, and I\u2019m not saying you do, but my patients tend to prefer pills before going on to chemotherapy, and I think way back when we initially again reconnected you were not in so much favor of chemo, uh, as he\u2019s already shaking his head, but I want to bring that up again because at some point we may need to go to chemo. So I want to put that out there still.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but we do have a set of pills. Now, the good news is every time there\u2019s an approved medication, you know, we\u2019re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you\u2019d respond better. So I like that study because it\u2019s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you\u2019re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense or if you\u2019ve got questions with that, but we\u2019re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that\u2019s in the works for us to consider. The other part is either way, however we move forward, there\u2019s another study, which is a registry study, called, Iron Man. Uh, not that you become iron man-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that all your experiences as to what\u2019s happened to you get captured. And that means you write out and answer questionnaires. I write out and answer questionnaires. Uh, and then about once a year we take some blood to see what\u2019s happening uh in terms of new research. Uh, and that participation\u2019s pretty cool because a lot of other men around the world are, are participating. And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone\u2019s experience will be captured. And they\u2019re all like you, in the same boat. So we hope you consider that as well. Uh, but I think what we might do is workup to make sure that you\u2019re eligible for all that stuff. I want to introduce you to M___, who\u2019s our research nurse, uh, who just wants to say hi, and then I think we\u2019ll have you come back in a couple weeks when you feel like you\u2019re a little bit stronger.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: How, how long have you been home now?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Two days or-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three days.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: From S___\u2019s.
