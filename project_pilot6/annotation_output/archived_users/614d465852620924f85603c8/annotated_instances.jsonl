Perfect.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And so I will be in touch by the end of the week to tell you what I\u2019ve, what I\u2019ve learned. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Alright. Thank you.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So just for, for now, Germany, I get what they want, the test results, uh, I\u2019ll see what the policy says about you know just paying for, for the drugs. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Can I just inject on the Cornell thing?  Clinical trials seem to me like they are very regimen and very time consuming, and I don\u2019t think your situation gives you that. So if you\u2019re willing to do Germany why would you spend this time looking at Germany connection, I mean the Cornell connection, when we\u2019re pretty sure about Germany?  I just don\u2019t want to waste your</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well, you know, if it\u2019s the same drug, which it is, and it\u2019s you know and-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And it\u2019s available.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You may not care that I\u2019m saving you fifty to hundred thousand dollars but it\u2019s those, those things.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: No. But I\u2019m just very uh the anxiety of the whole thing is, is he -</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I mean the Cornell group has a lot of experience giving you know radioactive compounds, just not for this one, because they\u2019re just starting to do it, so they\u2019ve probably treated a thousand people, maybe they treated three or four hundred people. No wonder that matters. It\u2019s just giving somebody radioactive stuff and making sure after that happens part of it does that big of a difference, uh?</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "very", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_empathetic": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "extremely", "pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "moderately", "pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_agency": "can't tell"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 56s "}}
{"id": "conv5080_1-snip9", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Because most of what we\u2019re looking for is how you feel.  Oh, I\u2019m having nausea.  No.  I\u2019m not having nausea.  Oh, this was a cakewalk.  Oh, my fingers aren\u2019t numb.  Huh, my counts, huh, you know, are fine.  Things that we\u2019re going to be testing.  So then we can sort of compare what blood test and symptoms are for those who actually get the vitamin C versus those who don\u2019t.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you have a fifty-fifty chance that you\u2019re going to get the real stuff.  Huh, you know, there is some flexibility.  They want you here at least twice a week.  But you know, if you\u2019re going to go on holiday or something, you know, we can switch it.  Huh, so far we know that giving high doses of vitamin C is safe.  Huh, we haven\u2019t seen many real extra side effects.  But we don\u2019t know the end of the answer.  Does it help with side effects?  Does it help activity?  Or is there no difference?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so you would be potentially eligible for that.  Huh, if you do a clinical trial, it does slow down a little bit when we get started.  Okay?  Huh, because we would first want to check your insurance company that they will pay for the clinical trial.  You\u2019re not on Medicare yet.  You\u2019re not sixty-five.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so we\u2019d have to check with your insurance.  Do they cover clinical trials, if you\u2019re interested?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, if they are.  Then in the forms that we give them and give you, it tells them, huh, what they\u2019re paying for, and it tells you what we\u2019re going to pay for.  So definitely the dummy vitamin C or the real vitamin C we pay for because that\u2019s experimental.  Your insurance company may have to pay for the time in the chair to get the medicine.  Okay?  Huh, if you have to pay five dollars every time you come into this building, huh, this study could cost you more money because you\u2019re here more often.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, but if you don\u2019t have a copay for visits, then that\u2019s, you know.  So there are some hidden costs.  You know?  If you\u2019re coming in more often and you have to pay for parking and, you know, those sorts of things, huh, we do have the ability for some of our studies to pay for your parking.  We do.

Where did you say it went?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I have to remind myself which side it\u2019s on. It\u2019s on the abdominal - it\u2019s in the abdomen.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: It\u2019s too deep to feel, so it\u2019s internal, inside the abdomen.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: It\u2019s on the uh - it\u2019s called the left iliac lymph node.
