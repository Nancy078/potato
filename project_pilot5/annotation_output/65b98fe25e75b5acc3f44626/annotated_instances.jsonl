And, and that\u2019s one of the precautions to see if, if the stopping of the drug for a week is causing the hemoglobin to increase on its own.

One is that if you wanted to pursue a standard therapy, such as enzalutamide, also called Xtandi, or chemotherapy, that would be through K___, because as a standard therapy, you will not have privileges, unless you paid out of pocket, to come here for that therapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: On the other hand, the second possibility is to participate in a different clinical trial. So I\u2019ll give you one example. So we have a trial right now testing immunotherapy against prostate cancer. That is a drug that stimulates your own immune system to hopefully fight and kill the cancer. Okay?  That\u2019s just one example. We might have at least one more trial that you\u2019re also eligible for. But both of these trials would not really rely on that mutation, specifically, but they are just trials that you would still qualify for, uh, independent of the mutation.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_empathetic": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "extremely", "pos_competence": "extremely", "pos_warm": "extremely", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_respect": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
