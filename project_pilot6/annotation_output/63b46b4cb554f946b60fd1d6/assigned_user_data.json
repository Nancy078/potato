Uh, they\u2019re four pills once a day, and their primary goal of how they work is it\u2019s, it\u2019s like a big hormone pill again. So it\u2019s to help your shot work better. It also is approved by the FDA because it helps you live longer. No cures. Same as we were before but we need to get a handle on all these things in the lung. In the same way, you\u2019re also a candidate for chemo to tell you the truth. Uh, so chemo\u2019s in the mix as well, but the majority of folks I think, and I\u2019m not saying you do, but my patients tend to prefer pills before going on to chemotherapy, and I think way back when we initially again reconnected you were not in so much favor of chemo, uh, as he\u2019s already shaking his head, but I want to bring that up again because at some point we may need to go to chemo. So I want to put that out there still.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but we do have a set of pills. Now, the good news is every time there\u2019s an approved medication, you know, we\u2019re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you\u2019d respond better. So I like that study because it\u2019s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you\u2019re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense or if you\u2019ve got questions with that, but we\u2019re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that\u2019s in the works for us to consider.

And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone\u2019s experience will be captured.

At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option.

This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it.
