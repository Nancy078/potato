And I believe we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it\u2019s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don\u2019t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don\u2019t know what the window is. I\u2019m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don\u2019t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn\u2019t, but I probably could. So, uh, the sleeping part, the OxyContin sometimes works, uh, when I take it and I go to sleep. But during the daytime while you\u2019re at work, I normally, I can\u2019t do what I used to do, but I can get along pretty good. We\u2019re talking about at night. We\u2019re talking about at night. And I\u2019m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven\u2019t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I\u2019m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I\u2019m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we\u2019re taking already. And I didn\u2019t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work. But, again, you never know. We were off of it for, uh, I think three weeks.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Three weeks. And then I got a call from two doctors. I don\u2019t even remember where their office is. And they said that, uh, my cancer had stabilized.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But they didn\u2019t explain to me what that meant. So what do you mean, stabilized?  Does that mean that it\u2019s not growing?  Does it mean that it\u2019s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it\u2019s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn\u2019t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I\u2019ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you\u2019re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that\u2019s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you\u2019re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let\u2019s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that\u2019s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we\u2019re going to have two more PSAs.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: To see if that\u2019s stabilizing at all. And we\u2019re going to know also from you how you\u2019re feeling in terms of your bone pain.
