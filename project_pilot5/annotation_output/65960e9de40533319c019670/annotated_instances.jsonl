So I will peruse the same store as you guys shop at because if I don't see it then how are you going to play it? So I do know Crest has one that says no alcohol that's a blue and I'm pretty sure Listerine is purple that's a no alcohol, so those are two really good ones. You know I\u2019d still cut it a little bit with the water.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member 1</b>: What about toothpaste?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Same with a lot of the whitening and all that is very harsh on the gums. You know there's Sensodyne, which is very calming.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member 1</b>: I have to do a prescription because</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh, okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "slightly", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_support": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
{"id": "conv5047_1-snip26", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay. Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So this is ascorbic acid is Vitamin C.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In this docetaxel. So you could use this as material just even docetaxel. It tells you what the side effects are, how often you need to be. The Vitamin C is the experimental part of it. So this would again be intensive to get it done here, but that\u2019s an option. And so this is the one about the immune inhibitors for ARV7 positive tumors and you have to be on the Enzalutamide.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh, huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And this is going to talk about how often you need to be here, what are the side effects, can we get you know the things like that. So this is homework to read to sort of say, \u201cHey, I would never consider that. There\u2019s too many things going on, I would never do it. Or you know okay it sounds reasonable. Dr. G___ likes it, you like it.\u201d And then we would have that possibility that once we\u2019ve decided you\u2019re no longer benefiting, we will keep you on the Enzalutamide and then we would sort of build this for you.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: If you are no longer benefiting but the idea is that I want to go to chemotherapy on its own or as part of the study vis a vis switching to this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: How long would the chemotherapy? How long would that last?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, so the chemotherapy, we tend to give ten cycles if it\u2019s benefiting you. They\u2019re given once every three weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Or if it\u2019s not benefiting you, we usually know by the third or fourth cycle that your PSA is rising and you don\u2019t tolerate it so we have to make some changes.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "very", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 23s "}}
