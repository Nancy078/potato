After dinner, just done. One, that will allow you to sleep because I think your prostate is acting up, it\u2019s too big which means it\u2019s blocking the way of the pee and then what happens is you pee but there\u2019s stuff left over but your body doesn\u2019t know it until just a little bit more accumulates in there and also your bladder is like oh, I was this full and now I\u2019m this full, okay, I got to pee again and when you\u2019re laying down you pee a lot easier because then your whole body is trying to recalibrate and what\u2019s happening. So, at that point you got to pee some more. So, if you give it less reason to pee which means you don\u2019t have enough fluid on board then you won\u2019t pee because there\u2019s not fluid to put through.
