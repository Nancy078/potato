Does that mean that it\u2019s not growing?  Does it mean that it\u2019s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it\u2019s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn\u2019t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I\u2019ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you\u2019re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that\u2019s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you\u2019re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let\u2019s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that\u2019s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we\u2019re going to have two more PSAs.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: To see if that\u2019s stabilizing at all. And we\u2019re going to know also from you how you\u2019re feeling in terms of your bone pain. Like, is it overall getting slightly worse over time or if that\u2019s stabilized, or is it perhaps improving?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In order to keep you on this study, uh, from the side effect perspective, we\u2019re going to need to temporarily stop the medication again, unfortunately- Because of this hemoglobin being eight point nine. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it\u2019s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose. It\u2019ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we\u2019re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we\u2019re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 4s "}}
