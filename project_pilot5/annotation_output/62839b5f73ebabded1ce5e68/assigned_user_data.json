It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can\u2019t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there\u2019s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone.
