They\u2019re taking out your cells, your immune cells so that when they take it they ship it to Atlanta so if you\u2019ve never been to Atlanta, your cells will be. They wake it up and then they ship it back to me, the like better version of you and then I reinfuse it back to you so that your cells know to find the cancer. That\u2019s the thought of how that medicine works. So, we do that, let\u2019s say the Red Cross on a Monday, I get your stuff back like on a Thursday and then I reinfuse it to you on a Thursday.

Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So, that\u2019s your immune system.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but before I get to that let me just tell you what standard of care will be. One might be the vaccine trial which is basically getting your own blood cells to wake up and try to kill the cancer yourself because right now it\u2019s kind of sleeping on the job Mr. S____. You have cancer and your immune cells are like ho-hum, nothing\u2019s happening. It\u2019s still letting the cancer do what it wants so that\u2019s an FDA approved treatment.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No cure but we have some long-term survival benefits so that\u2019s one option. The other option is a different type of chemo so a cousin of the chemo that you had earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The third one is a pill um and it\u2019s a like a super hormone pill that complements what\u2019s going on with your Lupron injections that oh, you love so much. Those are standard of care like we have no studies going on at Karmanos. I could pick one off the shelf and we\u2019d be good to go</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and you know, depending on what your scans show, I actually would favor Provenge, which is the vaccine therapy, because it\u2019s almost like a flu shot. We don\u2019t really know what happens to the PSA but we do know that if you get it in people who get it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Is that a shot or is that through?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, here\u2019s where it gets a little complicated. You know, the flu shot is also like a vaccine. That, you know, you just get here. But, in cancer it\u2019s a little bit more complicated. So, what we would do is actually send you to the Red Cross right across the street.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They hook you up to a machine and then they take out your cells so they\u2019re not using my cells or anybody else\u2019s cells. They\u2019re taking out your cells, your immune cells so that when they take it they ship it to Atlanta so if you\u2019ve never been to Atlanta, your cells will be. They wake it up and then they ship it back to me, the like better version of you and then I reinfuse it back to you so that your cells know to find the cancer. That\u2019s the thought of how that medicine works. So, we do that, let\u2019s say the Red Cross on a Monday, I get your stuff back like on a Thursday and then I reinfuse it to you on a Thursday. We do that 3 times and then the treatment is done. It\u2019s self-limited.
