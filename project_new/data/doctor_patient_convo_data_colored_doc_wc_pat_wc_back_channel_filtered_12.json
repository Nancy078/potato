And you said, okay, I’m going to do a little extra today, and that may be a no-no. You know?  So I, you know, even at my church, I got up and, uh, I think that was two Sundays ago or three Sundays ago, and, uh, I stayed up too long and I preached too hard. And I paid for it the next twenty-four hours of doing it. I should have just cut it short. So what I do now, is like last week, they had church conference meeting. And I came up on Saturday for church conference meeting to let them know I wasn’t coming up for Sunday services and had one of my associates to –</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Okay.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">-to to, because I can’t do both.

And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy. Of course, that would be through K___ because that would be standard therapy. Um, so that’s what the other part of my thinking.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Okay. And, and from my perspective, I didn’t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason. I came here for a consultation because I wasn’t comfortable, uh, with the options that I believe K___ was offering. I came initially for that reason. It’s strange that it was my dentist, so we talk about a lot. It’s strange how you get into certain things, uh, by having relationships with people who have gone through it. My dentist had, uh, numerous family members, had dealt with cancer, and he had recommended, he said, you know what, D___, this is what you need to do. You need to go to one of the teaching hospitals either here in DC you can go to J___ H___, in B___, and from my perspective, there are enough individuals that have come to J___ H___, that are close friends of mine.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Okay.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">That said, they shared with me that, uh, if you have a choice, go to J___ H___. So when I came up, my thing was the consultation. We had the consultation. I left, and, uh, and I didn’t say anything. But there was a follow-up that was set for J___ H___. And we sat down, and we talked about this. So we have all these options here. We did the genetic testing. And I said, okay, this is an option just like anything else. If it does not work, it’s not like it’s the only option that we have.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Correct.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">If it does not work. But, at the same time, I think you have to give the, uh, the drug the opportunity – to work.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Right.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">And that’s why initially when we started, and, uh, and L___, she said, well, Mr. S___, you have the clinical trial. And I believe we’ve, we’ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it’s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don’t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don’t know what the window is. I’m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don’t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn’t, but I probably could. So, uh, the sleeping part, the OxyContin sometimes works, uh, when I take it and I go to sleep. But during the daytime while you’re at work, I normally, I can’t do what I used to do, but I can get along pretty good. We’re talking about at night. We’re talking about at night. And I’m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven’t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don’t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I’m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I’m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we’re taking already. And I didn’t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work.
