That when you are taking an experimental drug, that\u2019s not a hormonal therapy, in this case it\u2019s .

Uh, so before I came in to see you today, I was kind of planning to say like this doesn\u2019t look like it has been working that well, maybe we should switch to something else. After speaking to you, and hearing it from you, I\u2019m kind of backtracking a little bit and I\u2019m beginning to think like maybe we should give this a chance to work a bit longer.

We certainly haven\u2019t seen that. On the other hand, we haven\u2019t seen like an obvious, uh, progression of the cancer either on the scans. So I would say, you know, you\u2019re certainly not the best case scenario on this medication, but you\u2019re by no means the worse, either, somewhere in the middle, and so that\u2019s why I needed some input from you as far as what you think we should do.
