But within that group, there are some people that respond really well and really long who probably are getting much more than a couple of months, and there\u2019s some people where it doesn\u2019t do anything, and they\u2019re probably getting nothing out of it. So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there\u2019s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you\u2019re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I\u2019ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I\u2019ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One, one to three years, maybe, let\u2019s say. Uh, another third of the guys, the PSA drops really nicely, and then starts to go back up usually six months or so, and then the third group of guys, usually the PSA is a readout. It just marches along.
