After dinner, just done. One, that will allow you to sleep because I think your prostate is acting up, it\u2019s too big which means it\u2019s blocking the way of the pee and then what happens is you pee but there\u2019s stuff left over but your body doesn\u2019t know it until just a little bit more accumulates in there and also your bladder is like oh, I was this full and now I\u2019m this full, okay, I got to pee again and when you\u2019re laying down you pee a lot easier because then your whole body is trying to recalibrate and what\u2019s happening. So, at that point you got to pee some more.

What do you think of that? Because if that sounds okay what takes forever is insurance</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: so if you\u2019re kind of conceptually okay with that then I\u2019m going to have J____, you know J____ who is our nurse, if you don\u2019t know J____, you\u2019re gonna know J____ in a minute.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Is that the one that took the\u2026</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_info": "very", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_support": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 16s "}}
