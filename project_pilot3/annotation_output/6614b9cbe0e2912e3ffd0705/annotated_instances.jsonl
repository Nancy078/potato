That\u2019s great for if you were just newly diagnosed with your prostate cancer or if you have some specific area on your spine. You obviously just got the radiation to there but if you know you\u2019re a baby, for example, and you had a really tiny spinal cord, and you have this cancer next to it, a proton would be the perfect treatment. For adults, it\u2019s a little harder to know what is better than the standard. So you know you hope maybe if you got protons you wouldn\u2019t have had so many side effects. That\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s not as mainstream I think as we\u2019d like to see it. At some point now when they\u2019re really up and running and more patients will get experience, we\u2019ll probably get a better sense of that.
