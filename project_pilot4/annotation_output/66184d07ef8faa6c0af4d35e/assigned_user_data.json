So, there it\u2019s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don\u2019t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it\u2019s just in bone. So, if you have it like in the liver or whatever kind of like when we first started</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I\u2019m not gonna fuss. I\u2019m gonna fast forward to say well, whatever that shows I think the question is, you know, what are my options. So, here\u2019s where I\u2019m at. If it\u2019s more than bone, meaning, oh, shoot, maybe that thingy in the liver and the lymph nodes and all that is actually there again and that other one was sort of a fake out then I think you need chemo and I think we\u2019ve been stalling enough for a while that the inevitable is about to happen Mr. H____ you just, you\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re just gonna have to do it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and that\u2019s with docetaxel and Taxotere is the name of the chemo and we do have studies with that so I just, you know, I always want to make sure we talk about that. So, you\u2019d get on Taxotere just alone once every three weeks. It\u2019s an hour infusion. Standard of care anywhere you go in the US.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and then our studies are Taxotere plus high-dose vitamin C versus just the Taxotere. So, two-thirds of the people will get vitamin C. The other one third will just get the chemo. So, everybody gets chemo no matter how I swing this</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: everyone gets chemo. Which is great for me, you\u2019re like wow, I guess it\u2019s great for you but you know we all have mixed feelings a little bit. I get that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second study is chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy versus chemotherapy. So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that\u2019s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you\u2019re just bone. So, let\u2019s say we do this and you\u2019re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it\u2019s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium. So, there it\u2019s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don\u2019t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it\u2019s just in bone.
