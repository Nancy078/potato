I was thinking the same thing.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So they will ask you then at our pharmacy, well, can you afford that amount of money, and if you can\u2019t, so they will work to see if there\u2019s grants to see whether they can, the drug companies who make these drugs, can cover the cost that you can\u2019t cover. Okay?  But you have to have Medicare D and all these other things. So it can take a little bit while depending on if they have it. And again, they\u2019re going to do a wallet check to see how much you make to see what they think you can cover.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well, I\u2019m working.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Well, right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That, that\u2019s just the rules that they\u2019re going to go through.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: I see.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Abiraterone is probably what I would prefer. Although for you, the downsides of it is potentially, you know, fluid retention. Huh, there is a lot of fatigue related to it. Huh, huh, we have to watch your blood tests a little bit. Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person\u2019s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don\u2019t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you\u2019re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, what would you recommend right now?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I, I like the abiraterone but we\u2019ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn\u2019t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I\u2019m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don\u2019t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don\u2019t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don\u2019t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren\u2019t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don\u2019t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can\u2019t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic. Usually that\u2019s what we go to next.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That\u2019s what I had before but they, radia, huh-</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Rad.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I hope that\u2019s true. But my experience with these really expensive drugs is you\u2019re going to get billed.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right. I was thinking the same thing.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So they will ask you then at our pharmacy, well, can you afford that amount of money, and if you can\u2019t, so they will work to see if there\u2019s grants to see whether they can, the drug companies who make these drugs, can cover the cost that you can\u2019t cover. Okay?  But you have to have Medicare D and all these other things. So it can take a little bit while depending on if they have it. And again, they\u2019re going to do a wallet check to see how much you make to see what they think you can cover.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well, I\u2019m working.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Well, right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That, that\u2019s just the rules that they\u2019re going to go through.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: I see.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Abiraterone is probably what I would prefer. Although for you, the downsides of it is potentially, you know, fluid retention. Huh, there is a lot of fatigue related to it. Huh, huh, we have to watch your blood tests a little bit. Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person\u2019s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don\u2019t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you\u2019re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, what would you recommend right now?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I, I like the abiraterone but we\u2019ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn\u2019t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I\u2019m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don\u2019t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don\u2019t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don\u2019t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren\u2019t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don\u2019t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can\u2019t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.
