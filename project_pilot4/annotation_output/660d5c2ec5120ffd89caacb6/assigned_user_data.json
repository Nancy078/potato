But you can get a slight, you know, nausea or upset stomach. So we'd have to figure out how that plays with you. Other than that, that\u2019s about it, so it's basically another hormone pill. So Xtandi, tackles one pathway of the receptor. This pill is another pathway. They are somewhat related, but this is not a chemo, it's actually another hormone. Yeah. So we're just trying to make sure you're super castrated, and then some, and then some.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: There\u2019s that euphemism for the Prius.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So, how does it affect my heart?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So obviously, we have to make sure that we take care of it, it shouldn't affect there's no direct effect, you know, it's not like, here's the chemo and Oh, boy. The Xtandi is, you know, always has a potential for heart issues, because we can't say that it doesn't, because anything that touches that testosterone pathway puts you in more of a menopause and accelerates heart disease. But that's true with your, you know, Lupron, that's true for all the other pills you've been on. Unfortunately, that's the main sort of active drug with all of this with prostate cancer. So that's the tough part. This one shouldn't have a cardiac thing. But again, this is a study. So if you do have a worsening cardiac thing that's reportable, because we would want to make sure that no other person has that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So they don't know that?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh, no, this is why it's a study. I mean, this is- you\u2019re guinea pig, once again, you know, like you tell us what's going on. But it isn't like this is a chemo or something that we're really worried that this might worsen heart disease. But it's always this- every time you fool around with the hormone receptors, you know, it can worsen heart disease in general. So I don't know about this particular combo, but that's why it's on a study and not me just go in here, take this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: What else?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And for how long does this study last?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: As long as you respond, we keep going. So if you are side effects, or too much, or you're like, Listen, I'm just done, we stop. If you say my gosh, this thing is really good. And I'm doing great, we keep going. And it's we can't take the drug away from you. Sometimes that's to the irritation of the pharma company, because sometimes they want to get out after a year, but it's actually interesting. One of my other studies, somebody's been on two years longer than they thought, and they want to close it. And we're like, well, I'm sorry, my one guy's doing great. So you can't take it away from us. So there's that other option, but in general, it's you who calls it quits or that the cancer\u2019s has moved on. And if that's happened, we got to stop.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Mhm.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We always got to watch your blood counts, because we always got to watch your blood counts. And that means white cells, red cells, platelets, and then of course, liver and kidney numbers. But that's blood tests. So you don't necessarily feel bad from that. We do know that some patients, their platelets go down a little bit. And that in some other patients, you might get a little bit of stomach upset. So not like full blown oh my gosh, you can't eat anything. And if that is the case, then we would have to, you know, modify the medication dose.
