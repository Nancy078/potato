Um, so um, the one standard thing that\u2019s left is a radiation-based thing but that\u2019s really only for disease of the bone. You have lymph node as well. So I would sort of not use that. The other thing that\u2019s left is chemotherapy, flavors, uh so that\u2019s something we could always go to. The other sort of unfortunately gray zone (beeping)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Sure.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh and some of that\u2019s clinical trial. A lot of the clinical trials we have right now are hormonal based. So it\u2019s Zytiga plus something, Xtandi plus something.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Versus something. So unfortunately uh you wouldn\u2019t fit all those trials because of the prior treatments we have.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then we also have some chemotherapy trials which we potentially could consider if we were ready to do chemotherapy. Um, the um, trial, the trial in the cracks that we have, one is an immune therapy trial. Uh so right now when we get immune therapy, the reason that we use it for a lot of cancers, they haven\u2019t worked so well by itself for prostate cancer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So one thing we can look at is what if we give two immune therapies versus one. In an earlier study we did we saw more men that it worked in more men. So now we\u2019re doing a bigger study. The down side of that is when we give two immune therapies the toxicity is much worse. So about half of the men I, I would estimate headed to the hospital with toxicity.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, really?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The main toxicity is really bad diarrhea. Because what these immune therapies are doing is sort of tipping the balance a little bit, trying to get the immune system to start seeing the cancer as foreign.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_info": "very", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_warm": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 4s "}}
