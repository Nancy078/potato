Might sound crazy.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I\u2019m going to write randomized. And that coin flip is random. In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can\u2019t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can\u2019t flip it again. We can\u2019t keep flipping it until we get the one that we want.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So in this study there are two options. One option is patients get the Xtandi. That\u2019s the same thing that I\u2019ve written on the the top of this page.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It\u2019s called G__?___. And this second drug has been shown in the laboratory, not yet in patients but in the laboratory, that makes the Xtandi work better and longer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And one of the things that this drug does, although it does many other things as well, is that it can boost the immune system. So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person\u2019s body, is because the immune system isn\u2019t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi. Now, I didn\u2019t mention this before but this medication is also a pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "moderately", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_communicator": "not at all", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "not at all", "pos_agency": "not at all", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_warm": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}
