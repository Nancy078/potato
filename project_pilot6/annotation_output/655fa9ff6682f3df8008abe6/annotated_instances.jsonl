So with this trial is first we check your genotype. So that's step one. And then if you are the particular genotype, which, for the purposes of we'll just call it AA.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That means that you're eligible for the study-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and then you get randomized to the muscadine grape skin or placebo. And if you are on the placebo arm, if your PSA, if it's if the placebo is not working, then you get the muscadine grapeseed. Okay, so, eventually everybody on the trial can get the therapy. Okay? If you're not this genotype and you're not eligible because we don't think that you'll, you'd have any benefit.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But to see if you would be eligible for the study, you'd have to first join the study, then we do this genotype testing. And then if you're eligible, about 25% of the population is eligible. So you have a one in four shot.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then if you're eligible, I think that that would actually be a reasonable option. Okay. The other trial is a trial of alaparib. This study is, a study of, it, so it's a PARP inhibitor. This medicine is used in breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and it's used sometimes in advanced prostate cancer, and we're studying to see if it can be used early on without hormone therapy in prostate cancer. Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower. This is like an expensive medicine that is provided but usually you have to go through insurance for all the clinical trials. So this and this one, I'm not positive that you're eligible for yet either. Okay. So those are the two clinical trial options that we have for biochemical recurrence.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
