I have a schedule with Dr. ___in January because the last neurologist that I saw, the one that put the catheter in, told me the catheter should not be taken out in less than four to six weeks. It should be replaced in every four to six weeks if necessary.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Sure.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So when I talked to ___, he said okay, then come in January and then we\u2019ll that procedure. So I don\u2019t know if I should go there. I don\u2019t even know what else he can do. I didn\u2019t have chance to talk to him personally. I talked to nurse and she did not explain correctly. Looks like he can\u2019t do anything for me except the nurse is taking catheter out and putting it in. So what other treatments he\u2019s going to give me, I don\u2019t know.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Dr. ____ or</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Dr. ____.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the issue really is we\u2019d like to get the catheter out and sort of when is your bladder strong enough to take it out, if we\u2019ve shrunk the cancer with the hormone therapy \u2013</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_info": "not at all", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_support": "slightly", "pos_competence": "not at all", "pos_respect": "not at all", "pos_warm": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 3s "}}
