{"id": "conv1084_3-snip2", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Is that what they did to him before when he went down there? They -</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Where the pain, where the pain was?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh hum, well there, they radiated you from the outside. You laid down and they beamed it to you, right. This is internal. So when they push it in your bloodstream it goes all around and it lands in the area of the bone that has the cancer.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Is there side effects?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh yeah, there\u2019s always side effects. Because it\u2019s radiation, some of the side effects could be you know reduced or lower amounts of blood cells in your system, so people could get low white cells, red cells, platelets. Those are your three guys that I always watch out for and in some people, it\u2019s a pretty big dip and you don\u2019t come back. Very rare, but it\u2019s a possibility.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: What do you mean a dip?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Meaning it destroys too much.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Oh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And there\u2019s no coming back. But you know in terms of how much does that occur, it\u2019s very rare. Could it occur\u2014sure, and I tend to see it in folks who have had a lot of therapy, especially chemo. You\u2019ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I\u2019m not saying that you couldn\u2019t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it\u2019s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that\u2019s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it\u2019s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you\u2019ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I\u2019ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut. So diarrhea, stomach upset, not so much nausea and vomiting but just more like you know you\u2019ve got the poops kind of thing. But for you it\u2019s obviously something we could regulate because you could get Imodium, you know. You could get treatment. A lot of my patients have it during the time around you know the week that you get injected and then nothing else. So that\u2019s kind of where it is. Oh, and if you have cancer that\u2019s not in the bone, like liver or lungs, which you don\u2019t have, but those patients, they don\u2019t; you know they shouldn\u2019t be treated with this medicine because that medicine that I\u2019m thinking about for you is only for bone.

{"id": "conv5014_1-snip20", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the reason I\u2019m mentioning that is because a lot of patients do want to go on this therapy without being on the Lupron at the same time or a similar drug.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the way that the trial is designed, if you give the testosterone without concurrently at the same time, suppressing the testosterone as well, then you don\u2019t achieve these opposites between very high and very low levels.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: What happens is over time is the testosterone just keeps increasing and increasing and increasing, and eventually it will begin to feed the cancer, at least in theory.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that is why we give both drugs in combination.

PAT Uh huh.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So every twenty-eight days which is roughly every four weeks, your testosterone will spike for a few days and then within about a week it will drop down to the very low levels.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: When you say spike, what numbers have you seen?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right, so I told you before that a real low testosterone level for someone your age might be let\u2019s say a hundred fifty to two hundred milligrams per deciliter.
