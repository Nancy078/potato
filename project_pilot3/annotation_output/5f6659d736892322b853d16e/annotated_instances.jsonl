(Pause)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I don\u2019t want to compromise your ethical considerations.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, in the realm of standard treatment, the two treatments that we have that are new hormonal treatments, we call them \u201cSecond Line Treatments.\u201d  So, the, the Lupron/Eligard is the first one. We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn\u2019t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It\u2019s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that\u2019s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that\u2019s kind of would be the next treatment that\u2019s standard treatment. It\u2019s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they\u2019re called \u201cPARP\u201d inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations. And, they found that none of the people without the mutations responded. Fourteen of the sixteen - so, you know, ninety percent who had a mutation responded to these drugs very well. Suggesting, they\u2019re probably going to work really well in patients like that. Um.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Am I one of those people?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, you\u2019re one of those people. Now, that drug hasn\u2019t been through the big paces of FDA trial approval. That\u2019s where it is right now. So, the trials we\u2019re looking at are looking at giving that drug alone or in combination with these standard hormones. So, the trial that I would consider for you have multiple arms. We could talk about that in detail, but, it\u2019s there\u2019s two different trials they could either combine the drugs or give you one drug. Um. But, the, but the, where the field is moving is there\u2019s going to be fifty trials of this to try to nail this down.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_warm": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_support": "extremely", "pos_info": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
