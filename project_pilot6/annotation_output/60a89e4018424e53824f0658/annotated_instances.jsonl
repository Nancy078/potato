And I came up on Saturday for church conference meeting to let them know I wasn\u2019t coming up for Sunday services and had one of my associates to \u2013</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: -to to, because I can\u2019t do both. Because it\u2019s like I will drive to go up. Really it\u2019s an hour and fifteen minutes and an hour and fifteen minutes to go back. Uh, it\u2019s a long day. And that\u2019s a lot to be in that car. So, uh, I learned the hard way. So, uh, my plan now is always to use them if I have to, uh, but, uh, I can\u2019t overdo it because I\u2019ll pay for it the next, the next day. It comes back on me.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So there\u2019s a bit of a disconnect in terms of some of the things that we\u2019re seeing and, and some of the ways that you\u2019re feeling. And I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure like in my own mind whether this drug is working or not. That\u2019s why I asked you what you\u2019ve been thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the parts of me that make me think that it\u2019s not working as well as we expected it is that the PSA level continues to increase.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, we\u2019ve probably told you this before including me, myself, telling you this. That when you are taking an experimental drug, that\u2019s not a hormonal therapy, in this case it\u2019s . Uh, just because the PSA is going up, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the drug is not working, although when the PSA is dropping, we certainly always interpret that as a good sign.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And, and your PSA over the last three months has continued to go up. Uh, and so that\u2019s one thing. Uh, on the other hand, you know, the scan that you had on August the first and August the second showed that the cancer seems to be relatively stable. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The thing that has concerned us before was that you were getting this sort of worsening bone pain in the left thigh bone and the lower spine and the left ribcage, which sounds like you\u2019re still having those to some degree. They don\u2019t sound as constant.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 42s "}}
