About two-thirds of the guys respond, and then one-third seems to have a long response, and one-third has a shorter response, and one-third don\u2019t. Uh, in terms of how to pick which one of those two. Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga. But the other reason was a tendency of less fatigue with the Zytiga than the Xtandi, in my experience.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Both drugs can cause fatigue. But it seems to be more common and often a little bit worse with Xtandi. So, uh, in my choosing those two, I have been choosing Zytiga, just for that reason. Uh, but the Xtandi is a little bit easier, because you just have to take Xtandi. You don\u2019t have to take another drug.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Why are you taking prednisone with it?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the Zytiga, so the way Xtandi works is, if you think that we talked before about the, the testosterone has to get into the cell and do stuff. It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can\u2019t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there\u2019s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there\u2019s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not, not that there was anything different before or after. So, uh, the two drugs, about sixty plus percent of men respond overall. So that\u2019s what I said.
