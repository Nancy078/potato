I said, no, I feel pretty good there. And, uh, so I do have those particular days, but then I have those days as well. I said, oh, man, when this day going to be over with so I can go to bed tonight</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Is that because of pain that those days are hard for you?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Sometimes it\u2019s, it\u2019s pain, but a lot of the areas that I wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t pain in, uh, not much anymore. My heel on my left side was having a lot of pain that I think I had shared, and, uh, I still have some if I go and overdo it, but other than that, no, my shoulders every now and then. My biggest challenge now is, is getting a good night\u2019s sleep.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And that\u2019s because I\u2019ve tried a number of different ways on how to sleep in the bed. I, I have these pillows that I prop up with a long pillow there, to try to lean up against the back of it so, I, you know, my back is up against the pillow. It works some nights. Some nights it doesn\u2019t work.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. And so you\u2019re having trouble falling asleep or is it that you fall asleep and then you, you\u2019re waking up with-?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well, I wake back up. And sometimes if, uh, you know how you try to get in a comfortable position?  It\u2019s trying to find that comfortable position for that night.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you\u2019re waking up because of pain?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh, not pain all the time. Sometimes it\u2019s just, uh, what\u2019s the term I\u2019m looking for?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Discomfort?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah. You know?  And, uh, just trying to get in a place where you feel like this is where I need to be at, I\u2019m happy here. So, uh, uh, one of the best sleeping place, and I hate to say it, is my living room downstairs on the couch. I prop the pillows up, and, uh, and got my favorite space, so when I lay down and put my back up right up against the back of it, but I don\u2019t want to be in the business of sleeping on my living room couch every night, either. We have a sleep number bed that we purchased just for this, but, uh, uh, I wouldn\u2019t recommend sleep number being if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going, you\u2019re going to use it for, because it\u2019s not all it\u2019s, it\u2019s cut out to be. You\u2019re paying a lot of money for a bed. And sometimes it works, sometimes it don\u2019t. So my biggest challenge each night is to figure out, okay, what\u2019s going to work tonight? Is my Lazy Boy going to work?  Uh, I even tried the floor with my granddaughter\u2019s, uh, what do you call those things she has?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: The bean bag.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: The bean bags.
