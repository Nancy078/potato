And uh there is a medication that is something called Niraparib okay. And it\u2019s sort of this family of medications called barhabiters. And the way they work is if your cancer expresses certain specific mutations, they it\u2019s likely to be effective. So if you treat everybody with your kind of prostate cancer on this medication, the chances of it working were wherever fifty to twenty percent, so pretty low.
