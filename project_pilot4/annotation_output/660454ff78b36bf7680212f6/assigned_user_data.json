It\u2019s sort of, if, if the doctor feels it could be beneficial, they\u2019re allowed to use it. So they\u2019re not allowed to sell it. They not allowed to make money. So what they\u2019ve been doing is based on using the same material to image prostate cancer. So we give this material with a little bit of radiation on it and it looks really good.
