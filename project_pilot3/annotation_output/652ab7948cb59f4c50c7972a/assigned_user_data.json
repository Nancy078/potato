If you give a medicine like mistletoe to interfere with the creation of those uh you know, what\u2019s basically hydrogen peroxide that kills ah the cells, then you\u2019re interfering with chemotherapy and radiation therapies.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: The effectiveness of the chemo</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So that would be something .
