That\u2019s from everybody within the building when you, when you come in. But the other thing is, when I come here to get lab work done, uh, I only get stuck one time. You know?  I don\u2019t like to be a big pincushion and you\u2019ve gotten stuck four or five times, and the person still hasn\u2019t hit the vein. Can I try your other arm?
