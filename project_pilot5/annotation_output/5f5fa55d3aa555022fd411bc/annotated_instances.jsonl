Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So this is ascorbic acid is Vitamin C.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In this docetaxel. So you could use this as material just even docetaxel. It tells you what the side effects are, how often you need to be. The Vitamin C is the experimental part of it. So this would again be intensive to get it done here, but that\u2019s an option.

Dr. G___ likes it, you like it.\u201d And then we would have that possibility that once we\u2019ve decided you\u2019re no longer benefiting, we will keep you on the Enzalutamide and then we would sort of build this for you.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: If you are no longer benefiting but the idea is that I want to go to chemotherapy on its own or as part of the study vis a vis switching to this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: How long would the chemotherapy?
