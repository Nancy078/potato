So, you know, we talked last time the chemo was just ready to go, just chemo chemo. Then we have the chemo that's a trial with regular chemo versus a pill version.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, that's not the first time we've done a pill version. It's the first time we've done it for this chemo. But like, there's an all time chemotherapy called FIVFU, that they made a pill version of that called Xeloda. So that's an active practice if you have like colon cancer, it's just not something we routinely use for prostate, but the idea has been around so it's not super novel, but we've never done it for this type of chemotherapy. So if it works, it's</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So is this what you want to put me on?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes, because the other one and just for timing wise, the other one is also fine with chemo, but the vitamin C, that's high dose. So again, natural but still high doses requires IV. You're here twice a week, every week sort of indefinitely. So it's a big time sink. So I kind of wanted to at least offer you the less intensive one, but also So I think very effective.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "slightly", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_info": "moderately", "pos_warm": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 55s "}}
