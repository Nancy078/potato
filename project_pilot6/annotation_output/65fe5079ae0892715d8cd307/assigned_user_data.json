At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board.

Your PSA is six something-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and it was two something before. So with that rise, I got a little worried. Because I don't want the Xtandi to get away from us. At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board.
