So, like you should get a bone scan because the last time was July and we\u2019re in October. You\u2019re in pain so maybe I got to look for new spots that we have to try to treat. That\u2019s one. Then, you know, a bone scan and then a CAT scan, but one that also includes the chest to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything up higher that maybe is causing some of the lower pain.
