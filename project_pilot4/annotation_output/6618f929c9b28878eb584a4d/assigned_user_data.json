What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah.

That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain.

I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you\u2019re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let\u2019s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that\u2019s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it.

Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it\u2019s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose.

And on that day, what we\u2019re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we\u2019re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But they didn\u2019t explain to me what that meant.
