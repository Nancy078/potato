It has to be you. Yeah. Um, Uh, If it\u2019s working we don\u2019t bail out, only if it\u2019s not working, but we will have, you know, the trials are like a moving target so if there\u2019s something that pops up and I think that you would benefit then yes, we would make that opportunity. So, I\u2019m always aware of what\u2019s up here which is why I pulled you guys back to say there\u2019s nothing here that is anything other than chemo but now as we\u2019re thinking about this I\u2019ll know, you know, by this week, okay, that\u2019s a lie because this is Thursday,</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: It\u2019s Thursday</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: by next week, what two trials make sense based on you know what\u2019s happening. You know, the hard part about those chemo trials is there is a group that only gets the chemo. I like that because everybody gets chemo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: It\u2019s the placebo thing?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right. So, it\u2019s placebo in the sense that the new drug is not guaranteed but it\u2019s not placebo in the sense everybody gets chemo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Oh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, if there\u2019s, you know, you\u2019re guy one and you\u2019re guy two you both get chemo no matter what. You might get drug and you might not.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I got you, okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One of them you know. The other one you don\u2019t. So, some it\u2019s like oh, I\u2019m just gonna get stuff infused in but we all kind of go gee, I wonder and it becomes a topic every time. The nurses try to guess. Everybody tries to guess. No one knows the answer except the people who actually hold the key. And then the other one is you know whether you get it or not because they just tell you okay, you\u2019re just getting the chemo. But, the difference is you know everybody gets the chemo. That\u2019s your standard drug. Nobody gets gipped out of that.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "not at all", "pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_competence": "not at all", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_info": "slightly", "pos_warm": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
