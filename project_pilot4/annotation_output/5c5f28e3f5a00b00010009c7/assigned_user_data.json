And, um, so often, and often would mean almost nightly, I am rubbing him with either Salonpas or Aspercreme or Bengay, one of the three, on his back, shoulders, legs, so that he can feel comfortable enough so he can lay down and rest. So, you know, that\u2019s how I see it. I don\u2019t know if he feels, if maybe I\u2019m interpreting his pain to be more than it is, but when he asks me to rub, you know, rub something on his back, in my mind it\u2019s pain.

For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there\u2019s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it\u2019s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it\u2019s similarly related to that drug, but that\u2019s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet. So knowing that, um, from my perspective, like I\u2019m going to be a little less sort of heroic and like waiting to see if this is going to work or not. Because it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve run out of options, and this is the last thing we\u2019re going to try anyway. You know?  There are other options out there. Because we do have those options, yes, one of them is a chemo. Um, we also don\u2019t want this cancer to advance too quickly that we miss the window and you get too sick and too frail, you know, to be able to tolerate those other therapies.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Fifth.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Fifth?  We would need to, again, hold the drug. Because even at the lower dose of two-fifty, it\u2019s still causing, you know, that significant anemia.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, uh, I just want to get a sense from you whether you think you might, you know, want to stick with this for about two more months until the next set of scans?  Whether you feel that you\u2019ve had enough and you want to try something new?  Or like where are you at with this?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So, can I give you my perspective-?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. Please. Yes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Of how I see it going? And then he can correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I feel like, um, D___ is in pain often, and, um, it\u2019s, I would say the past two weeks, I would say like maybe last week, maybe a week and a half ago, he was in a lot of pain and very weak, from my perspective, what I am seeing. And, um, so often, and often would mean almost nightly, I am rubbing him with either Salonpas or Aspercreme or Bengay, one of the three, on his back, shoulders, legs, so that he can feel comfortable enough so he can lay down and rest. So, you know, that\u2019s how I see it. I don\u2019t know if he feels, if maybe I\u2019m interpreting his pain to be more than it is, but when he asks me to rub, you know, rub something on his back, in my mind it\u2019s pain. When I look at his face, I see that he\u2019s in pain. So that\u2019s what I see. And, you know, it might be that he\u2019s like no, P___, it\u2019s not that bad. On a scale of one to ten, it might be seven, but when I look at him, I\u2019m seeing eight, nine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We\u2019ve got a thing to keep in mind is in your case we decided to try this study because of the genetic mutations that your tumor had.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it wasn\u2019t that we tried this study because you had exhausted all other options.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the reason we\u2019re saying that is because there are other things out there that your cancer has a good chance of responding well to. For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there\u2019s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it\u2019s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it\u2019s similarly related to that drug, but that\u2019s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet.
