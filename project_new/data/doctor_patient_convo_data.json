For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there’s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it’s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it’s similarly related to that drug, but that’s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet.

And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy.

And, and from my perspective, I didn’t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason.

So when I came up, my thing was the consultation. We had the consultation. I left, and, uh, and I didn’t say anything. But there was a follow-up that was set for J___ H___. And we sat down, and we talked about this. So we have all these options here. We did the genetic testing. And I said, okay, this is an option just like anything else. If it does not work, it’s not like it’s the only option that we have.", "DOCTOR: Correct.", "PATIENT: If it does not work. But, at the same time, I think you have to give the, uh, the drug the opportunity – to work.", "DOCTOR: Right.", "PATIENT: And that’s why initially when we started, and, uh, and L___, she said, well, Mr. S___, you have the clinical trial. And I believe we’ve, we’ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew", "PATIENT: that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it’s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don’t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don’t know what the window is. I’m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don’t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn’t, but I probably could.

And I’m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven’t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don’t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I’m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I’m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we’re taking already. And I didn’t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work.

Does that mean that it’s not growing?  Does it mean that it’s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it’s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?", "DOCTOR: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn’t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.", "PATIENT: Yes.", "DOCTOR: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I’ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you’re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that’s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you’re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let’s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that’s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we’re going to have two more PSAs.", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: To see if that’s stabilizing at all. And we’re going to know also from you how you’re feeling in terms of your bone pain. Like, is it overall getting slightly worse over time or if that’s stabilized, or is it perhaps improving?", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: In order to keep you on this study, uh, from the side effect perspective, we’re going to need to temporarily stop the medication again, unfortunately- Because of this hemoglobin being eight point nine.

It’ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?", "PATIENT: Hum.", "DOCTOR: I don’t think you’ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we’re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we’re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.", "PATIENT: Hum. Okay.", "FAMILY MEMBER: So between now and September fifth, a week-?", "DOCTOR: That’s, that’s two weeks. Yeah.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Does he go in for another blood transfusion or are you expecting the hemoglobin to increase pretty much on its own as he regulates without the medication?", "DOCTOR: One idea would be to check a hemoglobin level at a local laboratory, uh, one week from now just to see where we are at. And if it has made significant progress on its own, we can skip the blood transfusion. And if it looks like it’s only gone up like one-tenth of a point, then we can perhaps schedule a blood transfusion before September fifth.

And the only one of them that is helped by iron is iron-deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia is typically, one, caused by bleeding from somewhere.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Hum.", "DOCTOR: So, uh, I really don’t think you have the iron-deficiency anemia, and so, uh, I don’t think that will help that much, unfortunately.

I’m pretty sure. I’m pretty sure because, I mean, he actually had some degree of mild anemia before he went on the study.

And so J___ H___ will not be involved anymore after that?", "DOCTOR: So let’s talk about that for a second. So there are two main options. One is that if you wanted to pursue a standard therapy, such as enzalutamide, also called Xtandi, or chemotherapy, that would be through K___, because as a standard therapy, you will not have privileges, unless you paid out of pocket, to come here for that therapy.", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: On the other hand, the second possibility is to participate in a different clinical trial.

You’ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I’m not saying that you couldn’t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it’s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that’s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it’s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you’ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I’ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut.

At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board.

So this pill going right along, we want to add a second pill.", "PATIENT: Mhmm.", "DOCTOR: This study is to add a second pill, different pathway, to say hey, I'm gonna see if I add the second guy whether both together will make your PSA drop. But of course, to make things complicated, the second pill, they want to do stuff too. So they're going to have two groups. So if you're in the first group, you keep going on your Xtandi, and you get the second pill at a particular dose, no problem. Then W____ is on the same study, he's on Xtandi two pills a day. And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill. But his is not an active 40 milligrams, he just gets the sugar version of the 40 milligrams.", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: But everybody's on the second pill at the right dose, and the Xtandi. ‘", "PATIENT: Okay, I think I understand that.

So when M____, who was one that was calling you, she just wanted to know if you are even interested. Because if so we would have to get a spot. And then when you come in, you see a W____ equivalent, but just somebody who knows that study better. Kind of like a M____  and a W____hybrid.

We do know that some patients, their platelets go down a little bit. And that in some other patients, you might get a little bit of stomach upset. So not like full blown oh my gosh, you can't eat anything. And if that is the case, then we would have to, you know, modify the medication dose. But you can get a slight, you know, nausea or upset stomach. So we'd have to figure out how that plays with you. Other than that, that’s about it, so it's basically another hormone pill. So Xtandi, tackles one pathway of the receptor. This pill is another pathway. They are somewhat related, but this is not a chemo, it's actually another hormone. Yeah.

The Xtandi is, you know, always has a potential for heart issues, because we can't say that it doesn't, because anything that touches that testosterone pathway puts you in more of a menopause and accelerates heart disease. But that's true with your, you know, Lupron, that's true for all the other pills you've been on. Unfortunately, that's the main sort of active drug with all of this with prostate cancer.

So if you treat everybody with your kind of prostate cancer on this medication, the chances of it working were wherever fifty to twenty percent, so pretty low.

Because the way that we, oh no there’s a lot of stuff coming out. So let me first sort of describe what we call like the stages of prostate cancer.", "PATIENT: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: I’ll use the back of this. I think we talked about this last time, but I'll just, if I'm repeating myself and you get it, just say I remember all of this. So stages, so first you have what we call localized.", "PATIENT: Right.", "DOCTOR: -and that's when it's in the prostate. And that is when you had surgery. Okay, so the treatment here is surgery. And then we have- usually the PSA goes up and then it goes down to zero after you get your prostate taken out.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: And then it'll go back up. That is what we call biochemical recurrence.", "PATIENT: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: And that's when you have a rising PSA but negative imaging.", "PATIENT: Mm."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip3", "text": ["FAMILY MEMBER: Okay", "DOCTOR: Okay, so that means that because your prostate is out, we know that the PSA is coming from the cancer, but there's not so much of it that we can see it, so it's there somewhere we just don't know exactly where it is. That, you got radiation for back in 2007 because usually, when prostate cancer recurs, it first recurs near the prostate. Am I making sense so far?", "PATIENT: Yeah.", "DOCTOR: Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan. So that's a CT or CAT scan or the bone scan because prostate cancer goes to the bone. So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-", "PATIENT: Mm.", "PATIENT: DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows…so here are the, this is the summary. I’ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence. So when you look in the full report, what they say is that there is a it's less than once every here is 0.7 by 0.9 centimeters, so then that's like less than one centimeter. So when it's that small, it's like, really difficult. It's actually like impossible to characterize it to say like, yes, this is definitively cancer or this is not cancer.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: So that's why it says maybe, but they don't- notably, they don't see any anywhere else, okay. So then today you had your bone scan and the bone scans in shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Okay so these are your two summaries.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mm.", "DOCTOR: So this is CT scan and this is bone scan. Okay. So those are you for your information. So with, with that you really fit into the bucket of what we consider biochemical recurrence."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip4", "text": ["FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: Okay, which is good. Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.", "PATIENT: Mm.", "DOCTOR: Alright, and then starting treatment when you just when you develop metastatic disease. Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it’s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: So you get it for two shots and then you stop. What this medicine does is it makes your testosterone levels go to zero. So it works on your testicles which produce the testosterone and it makes them stop producing testosterone. So people have like menopause type symptoms.", "FAMILY MEMBER: xxx", "DOCTOR: Mm?", "FAMILY MEMBER: So you’re going to use Lupron?", "DOCTOR: Yes, exactly."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip5", "text": ["FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: So we use Lupron", "FAMILY MEMBER: Shots?", "DOCTOR: Mhm. So people get hot flashes. People get low libido, can have erectile dysfunction. And sometimes your testicles will actually get smaller. People can feel more fatigued you sometimes get some weight gain. There can be some cardiovascular like, um like changes in your cholesterol. Let me remind myself though, what other medicines are you on now?", "FAMILY MEMBER: Cinepro for high blood pressure. Cinepro 1800. Um..", "DOCTOR: Is it potassium?", "PATIENT: Potassium.", "DOCTOR: That's right. That's for the secondary causes of hypertension. Okay. Okay, so that is, so that's that approach. The third approach is clinical trials. And clinical trials in general are where we're testing some intervention to see if it is helpful or not. The two that we have for people who have biochemical recurrence, there's one that's a natural products. And there's one that is a medicine called a PARP inhibitor.", "PATIENT: Mm.", "DOCTOR: The mainstay of treatment of prostate cancer today is hormone therapy, neither of those two therapies are hormone therapy. Okay, so the clinical trials that we have would be doing, they would be giving you some intervention, but it would not be a hormone therapy intervention. So sometimes people like that because they don't want to get started on hormone therapy.

And so these are, the three general options.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Out of the three which one would you recommend.", "DOCTOR: Well, let me tell you a little bit more about what what the clinical trials entail, because then I'll tell you what I think, based on our conversation last time to what we should look into first.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: So the two clinical trials one is called the MAP study. And I might have briefly mentioned this last time, this is a study of muscadine grapeseed extract.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Yes you did.", "DOCTOR: Yeah. So this is a study-  is a randomized study for people with a particular genotype. So what that means is what what we know is that when some people take antioxidants like you know, these a lot like pomegranate or the muscadine grapeseed extract-", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: - some people actually do have an improvement in their PSA, their PSA is go down and, but when we give it to everybody, we don't really see an effect. What we found is that there are probably people with a certain genotype, meaning that certain changes in their DNA, which are like totally normal, about a quarter of the population has this."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip7", "text": ["PATIENT: Mm.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: Those people are more likely to respond, it seems. So with this trial is first we check your genotype. So that's step one. And then if you are the particular genotype, which, for the purposes of we'll just call it AA.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: That means that you're eligible for the study-", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: -and then you get randomized to the muscadine grape skin or placebo. And if you are on the placebo arm, if your PSA, if it's if the placebo is not working, then you get the muscadine grapeseed. Okay, so, eventually everybody on the trial can get the therapy. Okay? If you're not this genotype and you're not eligible because we don't think that you'll, you'd have any benefit.", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: But to see if you would be eligible for the study, you'd have to first join the study, then we do this genotype testing. And then if you're eligible, about 25% of the population is eligible. So you have a one in four shot.", "PATIENT: Okay."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip8", "text": ["DOCTOR: And then if you're eligible, I think that that would actually be a reasonable option. Okay. The other trial is a trial of alaparib. This study is, a study of, it, so it's a PARP inhibitor. This medicine is used in breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and it's used sometimes in advanced prostate cancer, and we're studying to see if it can be used early on without hormone therapy in prostate cancer. Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower. This is like an expensive medicine that is provided but usually you have to go through insurance for all the clinical trials. So this and this one, I'm not positive that you're eligible for yet either. Okay. So those are the two clinical trial options that we have for biochemical recurrence.", "FAMILY MEMBER: How soon can he get into the trial?", "DOCTOR: So what usually happens in general for clinical trials is that if you're interested in clinical trials, what I'll do is I'll contact the research nurse, and I'll say, you know, “Mr. H____ is interested in this clinical trial let's do it” because we have to make sure that your insurance allows you to be in clinical trials, and we have to confirm your eligibility and like for this, the MAP study-", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mhm.", "DOCTOR: -we would have you sign consent to do the testing to see the genotype first. So usually the time, from like, we're talking about it, and you are thinking about doing it to like, actually starting is a couple weeks.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Two to four.", "DOCTOR: It's always like, yeah, like, almost always within a month.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Okay.", "DOCTOR: So, you know, probably, I mean, both of these probably two weeks.", "PATIENT: Did you get the results I emailed you. The DNA."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip9", "text": ["DOCTOR: Yes. So, I got back the germline genetics testing. So this that this testing, well, do you remember?

So that was negative for the, for the cancer causing gene. So that was negative. That is a different that's different than this.", "PATIENT: That’s different than this.", "DOCTOR: Yeah, because this this genotype that we're looking for- it does not predispose you to cancer.", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: This is something that's very common in the population.", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: We just think that these people are more likely to respond to antioxidants.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Mm."]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip10", "text": ["DOCTOR: But the, yeah, so the, I can print this out for you too, just so that you have it for your records. The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.", "PATIENT: Okay.", "DOCTOR: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?", "PATIENT: Yeah.", "DOCTOR: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you’re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later. You know, having talked to you before. I think what we should maybe try and do first is see if you'd be eligible and if you have this genotype for the MAP study.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Okay.", "DOCTOR: You mentioned before that you were taking a number of supplements and you know, we're interested in natural products and how they may help your risk of cancer or cancer progression.", "FAMILY MEMBER: phone ringing", "FAMILY MEMBER: .

I hope that’s true. But my experience with these really expensive drugs is you’re going to get billed.", "PATIENT: Right. I was thinking the same thing.", "DOCTOR: Okay?  So they will ask you then at our pharmacy, well, can you afford that amount of money, and if you can’t, so they will work to see if there’s grants to see whether they can, the drug companies who make these drugs, can cover the cost that you can’t cover. Okay?  But you have to have Medicare D and all these other things. So it can take a little bit while depending on if they have it.

Although for you, the downsides of it is potentially, you know, fluid retention. Huh, there is a lot of fatigue related to it. Huh, huh, we have to watch your blood tests a little bit. Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person’s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else.", "DOCTOR: We don’t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you’re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today. Okay?", "PATIENT: Now, what would you recommend right now?", "DOCTOR: Yeah. I, I like the abiraterone but we’ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn’t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I’m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don’t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don’t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don’t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren’t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don’t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can’t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.

Your bone scan doesn’t changed much as you know. It kind of looks perpetually icky based on your original so you haven’t changed this whole time.

But within that group, there are some people that respond really well and really long who probably are getting much more than a couple of months, and there’s some people where it doesn’t do anything, and they’re probably getting nothing out of it. So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there’s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you’re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I’ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I’ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes."]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip12", "text": ["FAMILY MEMBER: Um hum.", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: One, one to three years, maybe, let’s say. Uh, another third of the guys, the PSA drops really nicely, and then starts to go back up usually six months or so, and then the third group of guys, usually the PSA is a readout. It just marches along. In your case, that’s going to be the primary thing for us because the bone, like I said, it’s hard to measure changes.", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: So, uh, and the, the biggest fact from the drug was in men before chemotherapy, it’s probably just because they were earlier in their disease-", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: Not, not that there was anything different before or after.", "DOCTOR: So, uh, the two drugs, about sixty plus percent of men respond overall. So that’s what I said. About two-thirds of the guys respond, and then one-third seems to have a long response, and one-third has a shorter response, and one-third don’t. Uh, in terms of how to pick which one of those two. Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.", "PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga. But the other reason was a tendency of less fatigue with the Zytiga than the Xtandi, in my experience."]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip13", "text": ["PATIENT: Um hum.", "DOCTOR: Both drugs can cause fatigue. But it seems to be more common and often a little bit worse with Xtandi. So, uh, in my choosing those two, I have been choosing Zytiga, just for that reason.

You don’t have to take another drug.", "PATIENT: Right.", "FAMILY MEMBER: Why are you taking prednisone with it?", "PATIENT: So", "PATIENT: xxx", "DOCTOR: So the Zytiga, so the way Xtandi works is, if you think that we talked before about the, the testosterone has to get into the cell and do stuff. It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can’t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there’s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there’s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.", "PATIENT: Hum.", "DOCTOR: And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.", "PATIENT: Um hum."]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip14", "text": ["DOCTOR: So what they found is if you give a little bit of prednisone, which is also kind of a hormone, it balances that out.
