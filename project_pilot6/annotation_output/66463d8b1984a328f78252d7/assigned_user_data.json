Your option two is the stereotactic radiotherapy, which I mentioned is called SBRT for short. that in order to make this trial a little more attractive to patients is designed ins such a way that the odds of getting the radiotherapy are twice as high as the odds of getting the observation. So in other words, you can think of it as a three-headed coin, there\u2019s a one out of three chance that you\u2019re gonna get the observation group. That\u2019s about a thirty-three percent chance. And there\u2019s a two out of three chance or sixty-six percent that you will get the stereotactic radiotherapy which most people on this trial want to get.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Now if you get selected to go on the observation which is a one and three chance of that happening, the study was designed in such a way so that all patients eventually get the stereotactic radiotherapy because if you had a trial designed that way then people would not sign up for it.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and you may opt out. For example, if you had say I just want to focus on treating that area let\u2019s just do it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: now one of the things that about the trial is that it\u2019s randomized.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um, hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: What does a randomized trial mean and in this particular case what are people are being randomized too. Randomized means that a computer and then essentially flips a coin and is random, very random in group A and group B of the clinical trial.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So in this study there is a random allocation of the therapy and random also means that neither the physician which is me nor the patient which is you knows So it truly is random. And also the computer program flips the coin so to speak, you can only flip it once, you can\u2019t continue to flip over and over until you get the condition you want</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So option one is what we call observation. Your option two is the stereotactic radiotherapy, which I mentioned is called SBRT for short. that in order to make this trial a little more attractive to patients is designed ins such a way that the odds of getting the radiotherapy are twice as high as the odds of getting the observation. So in other words, you can think of it as a three-headed coin, there\u2019s a one out of three chance that you\u2019re gonna get the observation group. That\u2019s about a thirty-three percent chance. And there\u2019s a two out of three chance or sixty-six percent that you will get the stereotactic radiotherapy which most people on this trial want to get.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Now if you get selected to go on the observation which is a one and three chance of that happening, the study was designed in such a way so that all patients eventually get the stereotactic radiotherapy because if you had a trial designed that way then people would not sign up for it.</span>"}, "conv5035_1-snip9": {"id": "conv5035_1-snip9", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Oh.
