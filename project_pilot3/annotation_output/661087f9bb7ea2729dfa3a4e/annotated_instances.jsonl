(Pause)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I don\u2019t want to compromise your ethical considerations.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, in the realm of standard treatment, the two treatments that we have that are new hormonal treatments, we call them \u201cSecond Line Treatments.\u201d  So, the, the Lupron/Eligard is the first one. We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn\u2019t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It\u2019s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that\u2019s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that\u2019s kind of would be the next treatment that\u2019s standard treatment. It\u2019s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they\u2019re called \u201cPARP\u201d inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations. And, they found that none of the people without the mutations responded. Fourteen of the sixteen - so, you know, ninety percent who had a mutation responded to these drugs very well. Suggesting, they\u2019re probably going to work really well in patients like that. Um.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Am I one of those people?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, you\u2019re one of those people. Now, that drug hasn\u2019t been through the big paces of FDA trial approval. That\u2019s where it is right now. So, the trials we\u2019re looking at are looking at giving that drug alone or in combination with these standard hormones. So, the trial that I would consider for you have multiple arms. We could talk about that in detail, but, it\u2019s there\u2019s two different trials they could either combine the drugs or give you one drug. Um.

It helps the pain but it\u2019s always something for something,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: not something for nothing, so there\u2019s some side effects there. And you got a lot of radiation.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So the question there being then probably safe to go back on the supplements?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: On some of them. I would gradually reintroduce them if I was you.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes. I agree with you.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And I also had a question about that proton treatment that they have in B___.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. Yeah.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not ah truly applicable to you at this point. That\u2019s great for if you were just newly diagnosed with your prostate cancer or if you have some specific area on your spine. You obviously just got the radiation to there but if you know you\u2019re a baby, for example, and you had a really tiny spinal cord, and you have this cancer next to it, a proton would be the perfect treatment. For adults, it\u2019s a little harder to know what is better than the standard. So you know you hope maybe if you got protons you wouldn\u2019t have had so many side effects. That\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s not as mainstream I think as we\u2019d like to see it. At some point now when they\u2019re really up and running and more patients will get experience, we\u2019ll probably get a better sense of that. But for now I think you\u2019ve got the best treatment which was those three areas in the spine and then your pelvis.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: But is this proton more precise than-?</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_info": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}
