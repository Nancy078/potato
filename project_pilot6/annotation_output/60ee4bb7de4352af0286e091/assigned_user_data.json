Huh, normally after three or four doses of the chemotherapy, huh, we have a sense of whether it\u2019s helping.  Your PSA may be lower.  Your pain may be better.  Huh, huh, those are sort of some of the clues.  Okay?  Huh, if we feel like it\u2019s, you are getting better, we\u2019re going to keep going as far as ten treatments.  Huh, if after three or four doses, your pain\u2019s worse, your PSA is higher, huh, I might even get scans after the fourth cycle to follow your lymph nodes.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, because if your PSA is going up, and your lymph nodes are getting bigger, we\u2019re not going to keep giving you the chemotherapy if it\u2019s causing all those side effects.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So we\u2019ll check probably after about twelve weeks, huh, about how it\u2019s going.
