One is um PSA level has now increased by more than double -</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: - compared to the first one; call that the baseline number. So the trial was designed in such a way - because we don\u2019t want to be giving people an experimental therapy and harming them by delaying improving therapy. So the trial was designed in such a way that it was built with a safety check.

So you have now crossed that threshold.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: A month ago, you hadn\u2019t and now you\u2019ve you\u2019ve crossed that number which I think was twenty-six point seven. So you\u2019re two points above that. The second reason is um having to do with your scans. We have the results of your bone scan and your um CAT scan.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The um the bone scan looks completely unchanged, in other words normal.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So we don\u2019t think there is any evidence or hint that there could be prostate cancer in the bone.
