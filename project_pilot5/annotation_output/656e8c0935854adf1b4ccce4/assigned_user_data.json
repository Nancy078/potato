I\u2019ll just give you my funny story because my patient when we first started, he was like number one or two and no one was travelling, right, he was like no, I\u2019m not gonna travel. So, now I\u2019m at home and it\u2019s Sunday night and all the sudden my cellphone rings but it\u2019s like nine p.m. and I\u2019m like boy, that\u2019s odd, who would be calling me. Not a number I recognize so I was like uh, do I pick it up, it\u2019s probably a telemarketer, ah, okay. So, I picked it up and it was some guy he was is this Dr. H____? I\u2019m like well, it depends, who wants to know.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: It\u2019s not the biggest thing because people always ask you what\u2019s your PSA.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, no, just say oh, I\u2019m on a treatment where the PSA actually goes up and like, you know, we have a vaccine therapy that that happens but Xofigo for sure and we know that because actually one of the fellows who is now faculty wrote a paper on our collective experience when we first started doing it and</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Alright. I have something to run by you</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um hmm.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: with me going out of town and taking this. Would I be alright to travel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. So, the good news is that we figured out that you will leave with a piece of paper after the radiation doctor gives you the injection because you will set off the TSA sensors.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You will actually set off most sensors even though if you spilled it, which you don\u2019t want to spill fifteen thousand on the floor but oops if you\u2019re butterfingers and it goes ping all you have to do to stop the radiation spread is actually put a piece of paper over it and the way the rays, they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not like, it\u2019s not what we call a beta emitter where it just goes crazy and everybody has to run, duck, and cover and take a little tick, tick, tick, you don\u2019t have to do that. It covers it and it\u2019s gone. But, the TSA sensors are so sensitive that it\u2019s even below the threshold of what the radium is. So, they do give you a card kind of like when you get a bone scan,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: um humm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: you know, they\u2019re like oh, I just had a bone scan, they\u2019ll be a similar card, but just make sure you travel with that because you\u2019ll set it off.
