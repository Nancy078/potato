And I paid for it the next twenty-four hours of doing it. I should have just cut it short. So what I do now, is like last week, they had church conference meeting. And I came up on Saturday for church conference meeting to let them know I wasn’t coming up for Sunday services and had one of my associates to –</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: -to to, because I can’t do both. Because it’s like I will drive to go up. Really it’s an hour and fifteen minutes and an hour and fifteen minutes to go back. Uh, it’s a long day. And that’s a lot to be in that car.

That when you are taking an experimental drug, that’s not a hormonal therapy, in this case it’s . Uh, just because the PSA is going up, doesn’t necessarily mean the drug is not working, although when the PSA is dropping, we certainly always interpret that as a good sign.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And, and your PSA over the last three months has continued to go up. Uh, and so that’s one thing. Uh, on the other hand, you know, the scan that you had on August the first and August the second showed that the cancer seems to be relatively stable. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The thing that has concerned us before was that you were getting this sort of worsening bone pain in the left thigh bone and the lower spine and the left ribcage, which sounds like you’re still having those to some degree. They don’t sound as constant.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, based on your interpretation, perhaps they’re a little bit better.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I’m not putting words in your mouth. Uh, so before I came in to see you today, I was kind of planning to say like this doesn’t look like it has been working that well, maybe we should switch to something else. After speaking to you, and hearing it from you, I’m kind of backtracking a little bit and I’m beginning to think like maybe we should give this a chance to work a bit longer. Um, you certainly haven’t had like the best possible response that we could have expected.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We have seen patients who, even in the first two months, their PSA level drops by fifty percent, and the tumors begin to shrink. We certainly haven’t seen that. On the other hand, we haven’t seen like an obvious, uh, progression of the cancer either on the scans. So I would say, you know, you’re certainly not the best case scenario on this medication, but you’re by no means the worse, either, somewhere in the middle, and so that’s why I needed some input from you as far as what you think we should do. I’m willing to stick with this a little bit longer. We don’t want to wait too long so that, you know, if something bad happens like one of your bones fractures or pain gets excruciatingly worse, uh, and so, and on the other end of the spectrum as well, your anemia is still there, so your hemoglobin level was still below nine. It was about eight point nine, uh, on the most recent check, and even if we decided to continue on this study at the very least between now and your next visit- is that September fourth?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Fifth.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip4", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Fifth.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Fifth?  We would need to, again, hold the drug. Because even at the lower dose of two-fifty, it’s still causing, you know, that significant anemia.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, uh, I just want to get a sense from you whether you think you might, you know, want to stick with this for about two more months until the next set of scans?  Whether you feel that you’ve had enough and you want to try something new?  Or like where are you at with this?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So, can I give you my perspective-?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. Please. Yes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Of how I see it going? And then he can correct me if I’m wrong. But I feel like, um, D___ is in pain often, and, um, it’s, I would say the past two weeks, I would say like maybe last week, maybe a week and a half ago, he was in a lot of pain and very weak, from my perspective, what I am seeing. And, um, so often, and often would mean almost nightly, I am rubbing him with either Salonpas or Aspercreme or Bengay, one of the three, on his back, shoulders, legs, so that he can feel comfortable enough so he can lay down and rest. So, you know, that’s how I see it. I don’t know if he feels, if maybe I’m interpreting his pain to be more than it is, but when he asks me to rub, you know, rub something on his back, in my mind it’s pain. When I look at his face, I see that he’s in pain. So that’s what I see. And, you know, it might be that he’s like no, P___, it’s not that bad. On a scale of one to ten, it might be seven, but when I look at him, I’m seeing eight, nine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We’ve got a thing to keep in mind is in your case we decided to try this study because of the genetic mutations that your tumor had.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it wasn’t that we tried this study because you had exhausted all other options.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the reason we’re saying that is because there are other things out there that your cancer has a good chance of responding well to. For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there’s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it’s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it’s similarly related to that drug, but that’s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet. So knowing that, um, from my perspective, like I’m going to be a little less sort of heroic and like waiting to see if this is going to work or not. Because it’s not like you’ve run out of options, and this is the last thing we’re going to try anyway. You know?  There are other options out there. Because we do have those options, yes, one of them is a chemo. Um, we also don’t want this cancer to advance too quickly that we miss the window and you get too sick and too frail, you know, to be able to tolerate those other therapies.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip5", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that, that is also in the back of my mind. And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy. Of course, that would be through K___ because that would be standard therapy. Um, so that’s what the other part of my thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay. And, and from my perspective, I didn’t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason. I came here for a consultation because I wasn’t comfortable, uh, with the options that I believe K___ was offering. I came initially for that reason. It’s strange that it was my dentist, so we talk about a lot. It’s strange how you get into certain things, uh, by having relationships with people who have gone through it. My dentist had, uh, numerous family members, had dealt with cancer, and he had recommended, he said, you know what, D___, this is what you need to do. You need to go to one of the teaching hospitals either here in DC you can go to J___ H___, in B___, and from my perspective, there are enough individuals that have come to J___ H___, that are close friends of mine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That said, they shared with me that, uh, if you have a choice, go to J___ H___. So when I came up, my thing was the consultation. We had the consultation. I left, and, uh, and I didn’t say anything. But there was a follow-up that was set for J___ H___. And we sat down, and we talked about this. So we have all these options here. We did the genetic testing. And I said, okay, this is an option just like anything else. If it does not work, it’s not like it’s the only option that we have.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Correct.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: If it does not work. But, at the same time, I think you have to give the, uh, the drug the opportunity – to work.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And that’s why initially when we started, and, uh, and L___, she said, well, Mr. S___, you have the clinical trial. And I believe we’ve, we’ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it’s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don’t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don’t know what the window is. I’m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don’t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn’t, but I probably could. So, uh, the sleeping part, the OxyContin sometimes works, uh, when I take it and I go to sleep. But during the daytime while you’re at work, I normally, I can’t do what I used to do, but I can get along pretty good. We’re talking about at night. We’re talking about at night. And I’m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven’t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don’t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I’m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I’m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we’re taking already. And I didn’t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work. But, again, you never know. We were off of it for, uh, I think three weeks.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Three weeks. And then I got a call from two doctors. I don’t even remember where their office is. And they said that, uh, my cancer had stabilized.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um hum.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But they didn’t explain to me what that meant. So what do you mean, stabilized?  Does that mean that it’s not growing?  Does it mean that it’s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it’s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn’t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I’ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you’re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that’s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you’re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let’s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that’s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we’re going to have two more PSAs.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: To see if that’s stabilizing at all. And we’re going to know also from you how you’re feeling in terms of your bone pain. Like, is it overall getting slightly worse over time or if that’s stabilized, or is it perhaps improving?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In order to keep you on this study, uh, from the side effect perspective, we’re going to need to temporarily stop the medication again, unfortunately- Because of this hemoglobin being eight point nine. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it’s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose. It’ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don’t think you’ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we’re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we’re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip10", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But it just might be that we have something that really does look interesting or promising that we can offer you. I don’t want to go into those details today because I don’t know when that time will come or if it will come. But if that time comes, when we’re deciding between a standard therapy, like the two that I mentioned, or a different experimental therapy, I can give you the consent form, and you can think about it, and if you decide to participate that would be through us.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum. Okay. Because I know the discussion we had initially, uh, was the chemo.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That was one of the options.

And that means white cells, red cells, platelets, and then of course, liver and kidney numbers. But that's blood tests. So you don't necessarily feel bad from that. We do know that some patients, their platelets go down a little bit. And that in some other patients, you might get a little bit of stomach upset. So not like full blown oh my gosh, you can't eat anything. And if that is the case, then we would have to, you know, modify the medication dose. But you can get a slight, you know, nausea or upset stomach. So we'd have to figure out how that plays with you. Other than that, that’s about it, so it's basically another hormone pill. So Xtandi, tackles one pathway of the receptor. This pill is another pathway. They are somewhat related, but this is not a chemo, it's actually another hormone. Yeah. So we're just trying to make sure you're super castrated, and then some, and then some.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: There’s that euphemism for the Prius.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So, how does it affect my heart?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So obviously, we have to make sure that we take care of it, it shouldn't affect there's no direct effect, you know, it's not like, here's the chemo and Oh, boy. The Xtandi is, you know, always has a potential for heart issues, because we can't say that it doesn't, because anything that touches that testosterone pathway puts you in more of a menopause and accelerates heart disease. But that's true with your, you know, Lupron, that's true for all the other pills you've been on. Unfortunately, that's the main sort of active drug with all of this with prostate cancer. So that's the tough part. This one shouldn't have a cardiac thing. But again, this is a study. So if you do have a worsening cardiac thing that's reportable, because we would want to make sure that no other person has that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So they don't know that?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh, no, this is why it's a study. I mean, this is- you’re guinea pig, once again, you know, like you tell us what's going on. But it isn't like this is a chemo or something that we're really worried that this might worsen heart disease. But it's always this- every time you fool around with the hormone receptors, you know, it can worsen heart disease in general. So I don't know about this particular combo, but that's why it's on a study and not me just go in here, take this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: What else?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And for how long does this study last?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: As long as you respond, we keep going. So if you are side effects, or too much, or you're like, Listen, I'm just done, we stop. If you say my gosh, this thing is really good. And I'm doing great, we keep going. And it's we can't take the drug away from you. Sometimes that's to the irritation of the pharma company, because sometimes they want to get out after a year, but it's actually interesting. One of my other studies, somebody's been on two years longer than they thought, and they want to close it. And we're like, well, I'm sorry, my one guy's doing great. So you can't take it away from us. So there's that other option, but in general, it's you who calls it quits or that the cancer’s has moved on.

So in other words, you can think of it as a three-headed coin, there’s a one out of three chance that you’re gonna get the observation group. That’s about a thirty-three percent chance.

If it’s more than bone, meaning, oh, shoot, maybe that thingy in the liver and the lymph nodes and all that is actually there again and that other one was sort of a fake out then I think you need chemo and I think we’ve been stalling enough for a while that the inevitable is about to happen Mr. H____ you just, you’re gonna, we’re just gonna have to do it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and that’s with docetaxel and Taxotere is the name of the chemo and we do have studies with that so I just, you know, I always want to make sure we talk about that.

Standard of care anywhere you go in the US.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and then our studies are Taxotere plus high-dose vitamin C versus just the Taxotere. So, two-thirds of the people will get vitamin C. The other one third will just get the chemo. So, everybody gets chemo no matter how I swing this</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: everyone gets chemo.

I get that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second study is chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy versus chemotherapy. So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that’s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you’re just bone. So, let’s say we do this and you’re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it’s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium. So, there it’s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don’t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it’s just in bone.

No one knows the answer except the people who actually hold the key. And then the other one is you know whether you get it or not because they just tell you okay, you’re just getting the chemo.

So I’m leaning towards if you qualify for the study, if everything goes right then you should go with the Xtandi plus BET inhibitor the study based option first and if that doesn’t work or if it doesn’t if you’re not eligible for whatever reason, then we go to the Lynparza.

So people get hot flashes. People get low libido, can have erectile dysfunction. And sometimes your testicles will actually get smaller. People can feel more fatigued you sometimes get some weight gain. There can be some cardiovascular like, um like changes in your cholesterol. Let me remind myself though, what other medicines are you on now?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Cinepro for high blood pressure. Cinepro 1800.

And there's one that is a medicine called a PARP inhibitor.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The mainstay of treatment of prostate cancer today is hormone therapy, neither of those two therapies are hormone therapy. Okay, so the clinical trials that we have would be doing, they would be giving you some intervention, but it would not be a hormone therapy intervention.

Because if your disease progresses, you got to get started on hormone therapy-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and sometimes people, you know, don't want to be in a clinical trial. And so these are, the three general options.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Out of the three which one would you recommend.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip5", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Out of the three which one would you recommend.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well, let me tell you a little bit more about what what the clinical trials entail, because then I'll tell you what I think, based on our conversation last time to what we should look into first.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the two clinical trials one is called the MAP study. And I might have briefly mentioned this last time, this is a study of muscadine grapeseed extract.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Yes you did.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. So this is a study-  is a randomized study for people with a particular genotype. So what that means is what what we know is that when some people take antioxidants like you know, these a lot like pomegranate or the muscadine grapeseed extract-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: - some people actually do have an improvement in their PSA, their PSA is go down and, but when we give it to everybody, we don't really see an effect. What we found is that there are probably people with a certain genotype, meaning that certain changes in their DNA, which are like totally normal, about a quarter of the population has this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Those people are more likely to respond, it seems. So with this trial is first we check your genotype. So that's step one. And then if you are the particular genotype, which, for the purposes of we'll just call it AA.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That means that you're eligible for the study-</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and then you get randomized to the muscadine grape skin or placebo. And if you are on the placebo arm, if your PSA, if it's if the placebo is not working, then you get the muscadine grapeseed. Okay, so, eventually everybody on the trial can get the therapy. Okay? If you're not this genotype and you're not eligible because we don't think that you'll, you'd have any benefit.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But to see if you would be eligible for the study, you'd have to first join the study, then we do this genotype testing. And then if you're eligible, about 25% of the population is eligible. So you have a one in four shot.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then if you're eligible, I think that that would actually be a reasonable option. Okay. The other trial is a trial of alaparib. This study is, a study of, it, so it's a PARP inhibitor. This medicine is used in breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and it's used sometimes in advanced prostate cancer, and we're studying to see if it can be used early on without hormone therapy in prostate cancer. Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower. This is like an expensive medicine that is provided but usually you have to go through insurance for all the clinical trials. So this and this one, I'm not positive that you're eligible for yet either. Okay. So those are the two clinical trial options that we have for biochemical recurrence.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: How soon can he get into the trial?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So what usually happens in general for clinical trials is that if you're interested in clinical trials, what I'll do is I'll contact the research nurse, and I'll say, you know, “Mr. H____ is interested in this clinical trial let's do it” because we have to make sure that your insurance allows you to be in clinical trials, and we have to confirm your eligibility and like for this, the MAP study-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -we would have you sign consent to do the testing to see the genotype first. So usually the time, from like, we're talking about it, and you are thinking about doing it to like, actually starting is a couple weeks.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Two to four.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: It's always like, yeah, like, almost always within a month.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip7", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, you know, probably, I mean, both of these probably two weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Did you get the results I emailed you.

The saliva testing that you did</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: He was going to try to figure out um.. if this was hereditary or something.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right, exactly. So that was negative for the, for the cancer causing gene. So that was negative. That is a different that's different than this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That’s different than this.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, because this this genotype that we're looking for- it does not predispose you to cancer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This is something that's very common in the population.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We just think that these people are more likely to respond to antioxidants.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip8", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But the, yeah, so the, I can print this out for you too, just so that you have it for your records. The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you’re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later. You know, having talked to you before. I think what we should maybe try and do first is see if you'd be eligible and if you have this genotype for the MAP study.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You mentioned before that you were taking a number of supplements and you know, we're interested in natural products and how they may help your risk of cancer or cancer progression.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I think that that would be a reasonable first approach to see and hear. You know, first to see if you're eligible for the study-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and then, get the genetic testing for the study.

Um, the um, trial, the trial in the cracks that we have, one is an immune therapy trial.

In an earlier study we did we saw more men that it worked in more men. So now we’re doing a bigger study. The down side of that is when we give two immune therapies the toxicity is much worse.

Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh that probably would also require you to have a certain monitor in your blood, and what that monitor is, uh, some men, particularly if they have been on a lot of hormone treatments, lowering treatments, the cancer evolves and adapts.

Because they can see uh, what we’re limited by right now is as I told you these lymph nodes are enlarged. That’s pretty much all the radiologist can say right now.

Uh, it usually picks one organ, not not all of ‘em, but, you know, you can get into trouble because your immune system – while it’s tryin’ to fight your cancer, it’s tryin’ to fight you.  Uh.

We tell folks that from that setting, we sort of says that people live fifteen to twenty months.  Eh, so that’s when we may get to the end of this year.  Uh.

Because if something goes really bad with this – let’s say you get a bad pneumonia, and we want to put you on a breathing machine even though the steroids may be able to bring you back, we don’t know that.

Now, if your PSA is just, you know, creeping up, which it kind of is, I know.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: It went up.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, it did, it did. You’re actually at, wait, you were….</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I was at 19.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You were 19 and you’re like at 42 I think</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Wow.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: so that’s a hint that uh-oh something’s happening. So, we’ve got 2 options because I’m going to assume that your scans might show something is, maybe 1 or 2 new spots or something. Not drastically worse because you don’t look it. You don’t, that’s not how you are. Certainly, you’re better than the first time I met you.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, you’re in better shape, better control, but we have to get early, you know, we have to get an early jump on this. Let’s say the cancer is back or it’s worse. Well, you had that run of chemo so we’re not going to repeat that but other options would be, we actually have 3 studies to consider</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv2013_1-snip4", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but before I get to that let me just tell you what standard of care will be. One might be the vaccine trial which is basically getting your own blood cells to wake up and try to kill the cancer yourself because right now it’s kind of sleeping on the job Mr. S____. You have cancer and your immune cells are like ho-hum, nothing’s happening. It’s still letting the cancer do what it wants so that’s an FDA approved treatment.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No cure but we have some long-term survival benefits so that’s one option. The other option is a different type of chemo so a cousin of the chemo that you had earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The third one is a pill um and it’s a like a super hormone pill that complements what’s going on with your Lupron injections that oh, you love so much. Those are standard of care like we have no studies going on at Karmanos. I could pick one off the shelf and we’d be good to go</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and you know, depending on what your scans show, I actually would favor Provenge, which is the vaccine therapy, because it’s almost like a flu shot. We don’t really know what happens to the PSA but we do know that if you get it in people who get it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Is that a shot or is that through?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, here’s where it gets a little complicated. You know, the flu shot is also like a vaccine. That, you know, you just get here. But, in cancer it’s a little bit more complicated. So, what we would do is actually send you to the Red Cross right across the street.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They hook you up to a machine and then they take out your cells so they’re not using my cells or anybody else’s cells. They’re taking out your cells, your immune cells so that when they take it they ship it to Atlanta so if you’ve never been to Atlanta, your cells will be. They wake it up and then they ship it back to me, the like better version of you and then I reinfuse it back to you so that your cells know to find the cancer. That’s the thought of how that medicine works. So, we do that, let’s say the Red Cross on a Monday, I get your stuff back like on a Thursday and then I reinfuse it to you on a Thursday. We do that 3 times and then the treatment is done. It’s self-limited.

We don’t take everything out. We just take a few things out.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh, man, no, we don’t take out anywhere close to your entire blood volume.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: It’s just like this much but to do that they have to sort of strain for the right cells. That’s why you’re hooked up to this machine that they have for like two and a half three hours. So, I always say, you know, bring something to read. They play movies. If you have to pee a lot, you bring a urinal so you don’t have to get up because if nurses will start screaming if you move and um there’s two ways. Like you have pretty good veins so um most of the time they can just do it straight from your veins.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They’ll tell us whether that’s possible. A bunch of other people you need a port for six weeks where they actually put it in your arm or your chest and they remove the stuff, you know, out and then when we’re done we pull it out. Now, go like this and you know that your veins are there. They’re not spectacular veins but I don’t think they’re terrible veins. So, it’s like three hours for us to do that procedure and then when you get it reinfused back on a Thursday this stuff comes back in a bag and you get it through</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv2013_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: the IV it’s about an hour.

Secondly, we help you through that so that’s on us and if it’s not approved you won’t get it because people can’t, there’s no way we can afford that so we just would leave that but I might just start there to see if we can get the insurance to cover it. Most insurances will cover it, most insurances. So, that’s one.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh-huh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, the study that goes with that it isn’t whether you get the medicine or not, that’s a done deal, our study is to know what happens to your immune system so every time we see you we take ah blood from you so that we measure. Okay, what is this guy who’s supposed to fight this kind of infection. What’s his level? And what about this gal’s cell? What was she supposed to do? You know, it’s like who’s sleeping on the job</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and then we check you for a period of a year because we want to know. Same thing like the flu shot is only good for a finite time, right, like this much time is in it. Well, we know every year you have to re-up on that flu shot. We have no idea about this medicine. It’s a one and done. So, our patient’s sign up for, hey I wonder what’s going on in nine months or a year after the fact. So, we hope you participate in that because it’s important for us to know so that’s one treatment option.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, after we do that, a month after that I rescan you again because by then it’s already about ten, twelve weeks that’s passed, almost three months, and then we see what the scans are when they’re done; if they’re worse, the same, or sort of the same. So, that’s all your two choices. Um, and if it’s not or if your PSA is now going whoa, it’s really up there, we normally then will say okay, we either got to commit to chemo</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: or pills.

So, we have studies there too. So, you got to say okay, what’s this study with the chemo. Well, you know in Oncology we love to combine stuff so the study is either the pill or chemo plus the pill. I know. So, it’s a win-win in the sense that you either get the pill get the pill that you were going to get anyways</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: or you actually get the double whammy and you get the pill and</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: and the chemo.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: the chemo and that’s a nationwide study so, you know, we would pretty much kind of consider that one for you.

The short name is Xtandi, the long name is Enzalutamide. And this is a pill you take it every day and it’s also four pills at a time. Four pills all at once. The dose is one hundred sixty milligrams.

I’ll try this route</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The chemotherapy has a name. It’s called Docetaxel and it has a second name and that is Taxotere. And this is given through the vein, intravenous, also called I.V. Intravenous I.V. It’s given once every few weeks. And I’m writing this down as an option just so you know what we talked about. But at this point in time, um I think that your cancer is progressing relatively slowly, if at all. Probably at slowly. And I don’t see any immediate need right now to recommend the chemotherapy. But it is an option, we’ll save that for later. I wanna focus our conversation now on the fresh option, which is the Xtandi.

Okay. And one way to make this drug better, work better and longer is to try to combine it with a second drug that’s experimental. Okay. So the Xtandi itself is not experimental, this has been approved by the FDA more than five years ago. It’s standard, does not require you to participate in a clinical trial and I could just write you a prescription for this medication. The experimental clinical trial that we’re doing which is research, so you would have to sign a permission slip which we call a consent form. Not today but after we’ve had time to look at it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um and I’ll just flip the page to the back. Okay. It’s a randomized trial. What does randomized mean? Randomized means that at the beginning of the study we flip a coin. Might sound crazy.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I’m going to write randomized. And that coin flip is random. In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can’t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can’t flip it again. We can’t keep flipping it until we get the one that we want.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So in this study there are two options. One option is patients get the Xtandi. That’s the same thing that I’ve written on the the top of this page.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It’s called G__?___. And this second drug has been shown in the laboratory, not yet in patients but in the laboratory, that makes the Xtandi work better and longer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And one of the things that this drug does, although it does many other things as well, is that it can boost the immune system. So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person’s body, is because the immune system isn’t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi.

So, uh, but it also affects some of the trials we have because those trials require biopsies of tumor tissue, and it’s really hard to get tumor tissue from the bone.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So it may alter what we can do in terms of trials.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So today, I thought we could talk a little bit about kind of what the standard things are to do next, and then we could talk a little bit about some trials that we have. The typical thing we would do next is either to put you on another hormone-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip5", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then a third group that doesn’t respond at all.

Choice two would be to give you chemotherapy at this point.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, I think, for me, what I would prefer is to try another hormone pill before we do chemotherapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Particularly because you’re not really symptomatic right now, I don’t think, and, you know, the, the benefits of both, uh, are about the same.

Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And it’s good for you and for me.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, we do have, uh, uh, the one drug called, Xtandi. We have two clinical trials, and those trials are both trying to make the drug work better by combining it with other, other drugs-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That in some ways compliment the hormone therapy. Uh, both of the two trials that we have, though, do require a biopsy, and I don’t know, I’ll have to go back and look to see if they’d allow a bone biopsy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The bone biopsy for you would be similar to any kind of biopsy. They have to numb up your skin, and put a needle, and take a piece of whatever they’re trying to take a piece of. For us, the bone biopsy, the yield is much lower, meaning they don’t always get actual tumor cells, because within the bone, it’s just they’re sort of taking a shot at, you know, what they think might be the tumor.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but those trials are, are, uh, the primary hormone in this case it would be drug called, Xtandi, plus another pill. So it’s a pill-based kind of trial in that sense.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum. Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, and the, uh, the other trial we have is my, I talked before about this bone marrow transplant trial, which, um, is, you know, more kind of aggressive, uh, and kind of still in its early stages. So I can’t tell ya much about- we’ve treated two patients, and, uh, they both did really well with the bone marrow transplant. One guy has been pretty stable for, you know, going on two years, and one guy’s disease responded, and then it sort of progressed now, and he’s, he’s on chemotherapy.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip7", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So probably one guy benefited and one guy has not.

So I think I would, even though that’s my trial, the bone marrow transplant trial, it’s designed for people like you who are young-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um, the, uh, I would rather first do something that at least has a track record of success. Does that make sense?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum. How do you feel about it? She wanted to end all this crazy stuff.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: I don’t think it’s crazy stuff. (Laughter)</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I get, you know, I think in the trials that they did with these drugs, and these are now not even new anymore They’re sort of old now. We’ve been doing this a long time.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, they did trials in men before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy. It’s kind of the dividing line. And in both cases, they saw that the men responded very well, and that it improved survival of the men.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip8", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, the survival part’s tricky because that’s the whole group, and some of the men, so, you look at the number total, it’s only, you know, a couple of months’ difference between the guys that get the drug and the guys that don’t. But within that group, there are some people that respond really well and really long who probably are getting much more than a couple of months, and there’s some people where it doesn’t do anything, and they’re probably getting nothing out of it. So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there’s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you’re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I’ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I’ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One, one to three years, maybe, let’s say. Uh, another third of the guys, the PSA drops really nicely, and then starts to go back up usually six months or so, and then the third group of guys, usually the PSA is a readout. It just marches along. In your case, that’s going to be the primary thing for us because the bone, like I said, it’s hard to measure changes.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, uh, and the, the biggest fact from the drug was in men before chemotherapy, it’s probably just because they were earlier in their disease-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not, not that there was anything different before or after. So, uh, the two drugs, about sixty plus percent of men respond overall. So that’s what I said. About two-thirds of the guys respond, and then one-third seems to have a long response, and one-third has a shorter response, and one-third don’t. Uh, in terms of how to pick which one of those two. Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga. But the other reason was a tendency of less fatigue with the Zytiga than the Xtandi, in my experience.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Both drugs can cause fatigue. But it seems to be more common and often a little bit worse with Xtandi. So, uh, in my choosing those two, I have been choosing Zytiga, just for that reason. Uh, but the Xtandi is a little bit easier, because you just have to take Xtandi. You don’t have to take another drug.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip9", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Why are you taking prednisone with it?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the Zytiga, so the way Xtandi works is, if you think that we talked before about the, the testosterone has to get into the cell and do stuff. It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can’t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there’s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there’s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So what they found is if you give a little bit of prednisone, which is also kind of a hormone, it balances that out. Uh, so we just give a once-a-day low dose, and that seems to be enough to keep the potassium normal. But some people don’t like prednisone. It makes them feel weird. It makes them gain weight. It makes them eat more.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh. (Laughter)</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And so, uh, the standard dose was twice a day. We found that if we just give it once a day, it’s enough to counterbalance the thing.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, so I think either one would be fine. You know? I think choosing either one would be fine. But I think that’s what I would do next is- now, the way I do that is, the other side effect of these drugs are they’re very expensive.

Uh, that immune drug, that, that trial, you get either the Xtandi plus the immune drug or just the Xtandi alone, but it requires biopsy. Uh, the other, the other trial we have is Xtandi plus, uh, a drug that affects we think a signal that the cancers can use as an alternative to the hormone signal. So they kind of switch over.
