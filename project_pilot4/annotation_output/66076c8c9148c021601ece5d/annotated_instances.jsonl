Okay. And one way to make this drug better, work better and longer is to try to combine it with a second drug that\u2019s experimental. Okay. So the Xtandi itself is not experimental, this has been approved by the FDA more than five years ago. It\u2019s standard, does not require you to participate in a clinical trial and I could just write you a prescription for this medication. The experimental clinical trial that we\u2019re doing which is research, so you would have to sign a permission slip which we call a consent form. Not today but after we\u2019ve had time to look at it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um and I\u2019ll just flip the page to the back. Okay. It\u2019s a randomized trial. What does randomized mean? Randomized means that at the beginning of the study we flip a coin. Might sound crazy.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I\u2019m going to write randomized. And that coin flip is random. In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can\u2019t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can\u2019t flip it again. We can\u2019t keep flipping it until we get the one that we want.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So in this study there are two options. One option is patients get the Xtandi. That\u2019s the same thing that I\u2019ve written on the the top of this page.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It\u2019s called G__?___.

So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person\u2019s body, is because the immune system isn\u2019t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi.
