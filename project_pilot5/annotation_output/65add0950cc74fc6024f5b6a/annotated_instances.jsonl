See how the lymph nodes and bone stuff is doing just to make sure we don\u2019t have to do anything exciting.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You okay with that? So that\u2019s the CAT scan again, there\u2019s the chest, the bone in the pelvis, and then the bone scan, which is basically stuff like that. Just to make sure.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.

That is definitely an option. I\u2019m not favoring that right off the bat just now. Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: We would do that as a last resort?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well yeah. I mean not quite last resort. I\u2019m not sure I want to wait (nervous laughter)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: What would you recommend?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay so my recommendation is mainly based on trying our best not to take away options from you, okay. And the way I see it if we go to Lynparza right now, this Xtandi plus BET1 inhibitor goes away as an option because you have to be on the Xtandi currently before when they can consider you for the study. So I\u2019m leaning towards if you qualify for the study, if everything goes right then you should go with the Xtandi plus BET inhibitor the study based option first and if that doesn\u2019t work or if it doesn\u2019t if you\u2019re not eligible for whatever reason, then we go to the Lynparza. I mean that is available to us as a fall back at any point.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So you\u2019d say try the uh uh BET thing and uh if that doesn\u2019t work go to the Lynparza which is the PARP inhibitor and continue with the Xtandi?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: With, with the BET.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The Lynparza we\u2019ll see, most likely I will stop the Xtandi at that point.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "moderately", "pos_info": "very", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_warm": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}
