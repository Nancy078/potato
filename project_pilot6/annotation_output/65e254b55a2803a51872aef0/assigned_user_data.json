And I\u2019m writing this down as an option just so you know what we talked about. But at this point in time, um I think that your cancer is progressing relatively slowly, if at all.

It\u2019s standard, does not require you to participate in a clinical trial and I could just write you a prescription for this medication.

In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can\u2019t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can\u2019t flip it again.
