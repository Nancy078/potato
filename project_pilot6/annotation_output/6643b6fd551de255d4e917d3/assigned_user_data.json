Okay, and are you alternating like number of pills per day or are you just -</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Four a day.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, so you know you don\u2019t have much room to go from that because that\u2019s the max dose. But when you break through from the bone scan it tells me it\u2019s really not working. The stuff that\u2019s being not - you know it\u2019s not in your liver or anything else. Like it\u2019s just still in the bone and you\u2019ve got pain actually suggests we could try a different treatment called Xofigo. And I mentioned this like a while back. This is that radium stuff that Marie Curie discovered many years ago. I don\u2019t know if you guys remember that from elementary school. But it basically kills, you know, cancer in the bones. Well in her case she died because she was carrying too much of it in her pocket. But in patients, it\u2019s now in legit treatment for men with prostate cancer that has gone to bone.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Does that look - something you inject, like a pill or capsule or something?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, it\u2019s actually, they put an I.V. in you and it comes in a \u2013 it\u2019s a liquid. It\u2019s like liquid radiation, and they draw it up and then they just inject it in you. It\u2019s like you know, it\u2019s like in, in over a minute, and it\u2019s once a month for six months. The person that is the expert is the radiation oncology doctor, and that person knows how to regulate obviously radiation. This is a form of radiation.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Is that what they did to him before when he went down there?

Because it\u2019s radiation, some of the side effects could be you know reduced or lower amounts of blood cells in your system, so people could get low white cells, red cells, platelets. Those are your three guys that I always watch out for and in some people, it\u2019s a pretty big dip and you don\u2019t come back.
