So uh stay with the Xtandi and the Lupron and bring in the BET. And uh I I\u2019m gonna be getting it from Midtown rather from here and they\u2019ll know that?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh well once \u2013 what I was going to propose is that I give you the copy of the consent. If you want you can read it and uh if you\u2019re ready to sign today you can, or we can schedule all the testing in anticipation of putting you on the study and all of that downtown and then that same day you can come in and sign the consent and do all the testing necessary. That gives you some time to think it over talk it over before signing.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And you said it would just be a couple days I\u2019d have to be there?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The two days are the long days. There are other days that you would be coming in and I just\u2026</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: For how long?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well that\u2019s what the consent will give you the exact details</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay, Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: of how many times a week, but the first few weeks typically are very, what this is called is a Phase I study. So it\u2019s an earlier setting like I said the combination really we don\u2019t have a good handle on what to expect in terms of toxicities, what dose, etc. So one of the side effects that has been noted so far is that the platelets can drop with this medication. So that is something of course the blood counts will be monitored anyway. Besides that kidney function, liver function, all that will also be monitored and checked. You go \u2013 undergo EKG monitoring that will be hard test like and echo before you start. So there is a lot of components. One additional component is that you probably will need to do a biopsy again as part of the study.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that\u2019s something to think about before you say yes or no.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And does platelets dropping how would that affect me physically?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well if it gets really low then it can cause bleeding and things like that -</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_respect": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}
