{"id": "conv5079_1-snip5", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that, that is also in the back of my mind. And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy. Of course, that would be through K___ because that would be standard therapy. Um, so that\u2019s what the other part of my thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay. And, and from my perspective, I didn\u2019t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason. I came here for a consultation because I wasn\u2019t comfortable, uh, with the options that I believe K___ was offering. I came initially for that reason. It\u2019s strange that it was my dentist, so we talk about a lot. It\u2019s strange how you get into certain things, uh, by having relationships with people who have gone through it. My dentist had, uh, numerous family members, had dealt with cancer, and he had recommended, he said, you know what, D___, this is what you need to do. You need to go to one of the teaching hospitals either here in DC you can go to J___ H___, in B___, and from my perspective, there are enough individuals that have come to J___ H___, that are close friends of mine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That said, they shared with me that, uh, if you have a choice, go to J___ H___. So when I came up, my thing was the consultation. We had the consultation. I left, and, uh, and I didn\u2019t say anything. But there was a follow-up that was set for J___ H___. And we sat down, and we talked about this. So we have all these options here. We did the genetic testing. And I said, okay, this is an option just like anything else. If it does not work, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the only option that we have.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Correct.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: If it does not work. But, at the same time, I think you have to give the, uh, the drug the opportunity \u2013 to work.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And that\u2019s why initially when we started, and, uh, and L___, she said, well, Mr. S___, you have the clinical trial. And I believe we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it\u2019s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don\u2019t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don\u2019t know what the window is. I\u2019m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don\u2019t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn\u2019t, but I probably could. So, uh, the sleeping part, the OxyContin sometimes works, uh, when I take it and I go to sleep. But during the daytime while you\u2019re at work, I normally, I can\u2019t do what I used to do, but I can get along pretty good. We\u2019re talking about at night. We\u2019re talking about at night. And I\u2019m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven\u2019t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I\u2019m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I\u2019m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we\u2019re taking already. And I didn\u2019t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work. But, again, you never know.
