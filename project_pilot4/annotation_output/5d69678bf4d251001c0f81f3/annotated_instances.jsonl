We\u2019re always perpetually paranoid about clots. You know that. Any type of blood clot.

But that leg, you know, we always have to fuss about because we know your bone scan can change at any time. I know we finished chemo but it might be time to figure out what else is happening.

Your bone scan doesn\u2019t changed much as you know. It kind of looks perpetually icky based on your original so you haven\u2019t changed this whole time. I\u2019m looking to see if there\u2019s new spots in the leg or anywhere else.

At one point we talked to acupuncturist and he said he can help through acupuncture with peeing problems. So and I was thinking we\u2019d go on the day when we take the catheter our, but now I\u2019m thinking maybe I should wait. And now if that is okay, see if that may be some additional help.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s reasonable to try. You know most acupuncturists will ask you about your current situation \u2013</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: - and see how well it would help. You know my worry is you know if you\u2019re spending money on that then how does it help? You know if they are doing it and you get the catheter out is it because of my drug or because they gave you, you know acupuncture and how long you paid them?</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_info": "moderately", "pos_respect": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}

Like it\u2019s just still in the bone and you\u2019ve got pain actually suggests we could try a different treatment called Xofigo. And I mentioned this like a while back. This is that radium stuff that Marie Curie discovered many years ago. I don\u2019t know if you guys remember that from elementary school. But it basically kills, you know, cancer in the bones.
