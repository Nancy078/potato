For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there’s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it’s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it’s similarly related to that drug, but that’s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet.

There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you’re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let’s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that’s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it.

Like it’s just still in the bone and you’ve got pain actually suggests we could try a different treatment called Xofigo. And I mentioned this like a while back. This is that radium stuff that Marie Curie discovered many years ago. I don’t know if you guys remember that from elementary school. But it basically kills, you know, cancer in the bones.

But you know in terms of how much does that occur, it’s very rare. Could it occur—sure, and I tend to see it in folks who have had a lot of therapy, especially chemo. You’ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I’m not saying that you couldn’t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it’s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that’s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it’s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you’ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I’ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut. So diarrhea, stomach upset, not so much nausea and vomiting but just more like you know you’ve got the poops kind of thing.

A lot of my patients have it during the time around you know the week that you get injected and then nothing else. So that’s kind of where it is. Oh, and if you have cancer that’s not in the bone, like liver or lungs, which you don’t have, but those patients, they don’t; you know they shouldn’t be treated with this medicine because that medicine that I’m thinking about for you is only for bone.

So with that rise, I got a little worried. Because I don't want the Xtandi to get away from us. At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board. You still with me?</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">No, you gotta slow down.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Okay.

So, sometimes the cancer gets smart. And now we say look, maybe there's a way to kind of flap that, see if we can get it to work again, because it did work for a while, which was good. So this pill going right along, we want to add a second pill.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Mhmm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">This study is to add a second pill, different pathway, to say hey, I'm gonna see if I add the second guy whether both together will make your PSA drop. But of course, to make things complicated, the second pill, they want to do stuff too. So they're going to have two groups. So if you're in the first group, you keep going on your Xtandi, and you get the second pill at a particular dose, no problem. Then W____ is on the same study, he's on Xtandi two pills a day. And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill. But his is not an active 40 milligrams, he just gets the sugar version of the 40 milligrams.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Okay.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">But everybody's on the second pill at the right dose, and the Xtandi. ‘</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Okay, I think I understand that.

So when M____, who was one that was calling you, she just wanted to know if you are even interested. Because if so we would have to get a spot. And then when you come in, you see a W____ equivalent, but just somebody who knows that study better. Kind of like a M____  and a W____hybrid.

So not like full blown oh my gosh, you can't eat anything. And if that is the case, then we would have to, you know, modify the medication dose. But you can get a slight, you know, nausea or upset stomach. So we'd have to figure out how that plays with you. Other than that, that’s about it, so it's basically another hormone pill.

But that's true with your, you know, Lupron, that's true for all the other pills you've been on. Unfortunately, that's the main sort of active drug with all of this with prostate cancer.

So, you get broken DNA from all kinds of things Carcinogens, sunlight, um, all kinds of things - hormonal things, and the cells has to repair that. And, they’re very good at repairing it, um, but when you have a mutation, it screws up a bit -- that, and, so, it predisposes you to cancer. What we’ve found is if we give a drug that blocks another DNA repair enzyme. So, now the cancer cells maybe inherit a bad one, and we block one chemically. For some reason, it doesn’t like having two blocked, and the cancer cells die. So, we sometimes see people respond really well to these new drugs that we treating with. The other thing that we think is happening is, um, when you have DNA repair mutation, the cells - the cancer cells can start making abnormal proteins, and those are recognized by the immune system better.

We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn’t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It’s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that’s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that’s kind of would be the next treatment that’s standard treatment. It’s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they’re called “PARP” inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations.

That, you got radiation for back in 2007 because usually, when prostate cancer recurs, it first recurs near the prostate. Am I making sense so far?</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Yeah.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan. So that's a CT or CAT scan or the bone scan because prostate cancer goes to the bone. So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Mm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows…so here are the, this is the summary. I’ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence. So when you look in the full report, what they say is that there is a it's less than once every here is 0.7 by 0.9 centimeters, so then that's like less than one centimeter. So when it's that small, it's like, really difficult. It's actually like impossible to characterize it to say like, yes, this is definitively cancer or this is not cancer.</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Mhm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">So that's why it says maybe, but they don't- notably, they don't see any anywhere else, okay.

Okay so these are your two summaries.</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Mm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">So this is CT scan and this is bone scan.

Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Mm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Alright, and then starting treatment when you just when you develop metastatic disease. Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it’s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Mhm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">So you get it for two shots and then you stop. What this medicine does is it makes your testosterone levels go to zero. So it works on your testicles which produce the testosterone and it makes them stop producing testosterone. So people have like menopause type symptoms.</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">xxx</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Mm?</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">So you’re going to use Lupron?</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Yes, exactly.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip5", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Mhm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">So we use Lupron</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Shots?</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Mhm. So people get hot flashes. People get low libido, can have erectile dysfunction. And sometimes your testicles will actually get smaller. People can feel more fatigued you sometimes get some weight gain. There can be some cardiovascular like, um like changes in your cholesterol. Let me remind myself though, what other medicines are you on now?</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Cinepro for high blood pressure.

That's for the secondary causes of hypertension. Okay. Okay, so that is, so that's that approach. The third approach is clinical trials. And clinical trials in general are where we're testing some intervention to see if it is helpful or not. The two that we have for people who have biochemical recurrence, there's one that's a natural products. And there's one that is a medicine called a PARP inhibitor.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Mm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">The mainstay of treatment of prostate cancer today is hormone therapy, neither of those two therapies are hormone therapy.

Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower.

Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you’re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later.

I mean you really haven’t had any side effects, haven’t felt any different, managed to keep up with everything you want to do. So that’s been remarkable. The PSA last couple of times as we discussed last time has been going up. Okay. One of my concerns is if it keeps going up but the scans don’t change, do we stay the same course?

And, or if we want to give it one more try with doing a different kind of hormonal therapy, we have a new hormone therapy agent that we are testing here you know that’s been through multiple people who have had it and there’s been some promising results initially so I think that would be another option.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv1057_1-snip3", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Mm Hmm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">But you know so those are probably the potential choices. The third possible choice and that would depend on your CAT scans had some lymph nodes though that were seen so there is a study with a combination of two different therapies. Okay? One is the Xofigo which is a radiation treatment that’s approved. You’ve probably heard of it I know.</span>", "", "<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Mm Hmm.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">It’s a treatment that only goes to the bones in prostate cancer and helps kill the cancer in the bones.

Huh, the average person’s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">We don’t change therapy based on PSA.

I, I like the abiraterone but we’ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn’t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I’m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don’t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don’t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don’t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren’t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don’t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can’t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.

But within that group, there are some people that respond really well and really long who probably are getting much more than a couple of months, and there’s some people where it doesn’t do anything, and they’re probably getting nothing out of it. So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there’s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you’re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I’ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I’ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip12", "text": ["<span class=\"greenText\">FAMILY MEMBER</span>: <span class=\"greenText\">Um hum.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Um hum.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">One, one to three years, maybe, let’s say. Uh, another third of the guys, the PSA drops really nicely, and then starts to go back up usually six months or so, and then the third group of guys, usually the PSA is a readout. It just marches along.

Uh, in terms of how to pick which one of those two. Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Um hum.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga.

It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can’t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there’s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there’s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Hum.</span>", "", "<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.</span>", "", "<span class=\"blueText\">PATIENT</span>: <span class=\"blueText\">Um hum.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5077_1-snip14", "text": ["<span class=\"redText\">DOCTOR</span>: <span class=\"redText\">So what they found is if you give a little bit of prednisone, which is also kind of a hormone, it balances that out.
