And the way that this usually works is that well, for any treatment, we continue the treatment until either disease progression, meaning that your disease is getting worse despite the treatments of the treatments not working anymore, or unacceptable toxicity.

The most common one is gassiness. So you might not be the most pleasant person to be around while you're taking this, but that's, I mean, it's only 8%. So it's not really that common, but most people usually do fine there. Been no serious side effects. So, you know, it's very safe for us it doesn't cost anything there are no extra costs it's just what would be done in normal clinical care anyways is what they've done anything that would be extra that's like not covered by insurance like this blood test, to check your genotype it\u2019s covered by the study.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You don't get paid to join the study, you can leave at any time to protect your privacy, you do tend to get parking tickets, so that like you know, when you come visits okay and then these are the this is the contact information for our clinic.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So it\u2019s a monthly, a monthly thing?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So the treatment you actually take every single day, so, the pills, so what you what you do usually is that you come in, we make sure that you're taking you after usually fill out a drug diary so that we see how many like if you're missing days, you take the pills, and then we would give you refills of the pills.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay, so will there be a blood test when he comes back also?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah.
