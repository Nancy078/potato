{"id":"1","text":"Instructions:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["This project aims to understand patient perceptions of doctor-patient interactions. In this task, you will be presented with small parts of different conversations between doctors and patients. In each conversation, the patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer and the doctor talks to him about his treatments. Some topics the doctor may discuss are: the patient's health condition, a new trial or treatment, his eligibility to enroll in the trial, and the doctor’s recommendations. There might be family members and healthcare workers present as well. <br></br>  <br>You will rate these parts based on the qualities of the patient (such as competence) and the doctor (such as empathy), You will do this from the point of view of the patient. Some items might not apply to this part of the conversation, so you can put 'not applicable' (N/A). Please rate these based on your own understanding of the qualities (agency, competence, partnership-building etc.)</br>  <br></br>  <br>To check out the definition of these qualities, you can click on “Annotation Codebook” on the top navigation bar.</br>"]}
