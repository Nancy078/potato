So yeah, so 80 people total are going to be in it.

And the way that this usually works is that well, for any treatment, we continue the treatment until either disease progression, meaning that your disease is getting worse despite the treatments of the treatments not working anymore, or unacceptable toxicity.

So it's not really that common, but most people usually do fine there. Been no serious side effects. So, you know, it's very safe for us it doesn't cost anything there are no extra costs it's just what would be done in normal clinical care anyways is what they've done anything that would be extra that's like not covered by insurance like this blood test, to check your genotype it\u2019s covered by the study.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: You don't get paid to join the study, you can leave at any time to protect your privacy, you do tend to get parking tickets, so that like you know, when you come visits okay and then these are the this is the contact information for our clinic.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_competence": "extremely", "pos_warm": "extremely", "pos_empathetic": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "extremely", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_support": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}

So it\u2019s a pill-based kind of trial in that sense.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum. Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, and the, uh, the other trial we have is my, I talked before about this bone marrow transplant trial, which, um, is, you know, more kind of aggressive, uh, and kind of still in its early stages. So I can\u2019t tell ya much about- we\u2019ve treated two patients, and, uh, they both did really well with the bone marrow transplant. One guy has been pretty stable for, you know, going on two years, and one guy\u2019s disease responded, and then it sort of progressed now, and he\u2019s, he\u2019s on chemotherapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So probably one guy benefited and one guy has not. Uh, we\u2019re about to do a third guy probably in the next few weeks. So, uh, but I think that trial I would probably want you to have at least been on one of the hormone drugs first.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Because those drugs do improve how long people live and are relatively easy. So I think I would, even though that\u2019s my trial, the bone marrow transplant trial, it\u2019s designed for people like you who are young-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um, the, uh, I would rather first do something that at least has a track record of success.
