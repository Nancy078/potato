Which is great for me, you\u2019re like wow, I guess it\u2019s great for you but you know we all have mixed feelings a little bit. I get that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second study is chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy versus chemotherapy. So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that\u2019s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you\u2019re just bone. So, let\u2019s say we do this and you\u2019re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it\u2019s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium. So, there it\u2019s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don\u2019t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it\u2019s just in bone. So, if you have it like in the liver or whatever kind of like when we first started</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: it was like oh, no you kind of had these bits and pieces,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: one, your insurance won\u2019t approve it and number two it\u2019s the wrong treatment.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But, if that\u2019s sort of gone and nowhere to be found on this CAT scan then I think radium is it. Now, radium does two things. One is that it helps you live longer but also helps with pain so those people who are, you know, whether you\u2019re taking a Tylenol over-the-counter or you\u2019re taking actual narcotics that should improve.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>"}, "conv6019_1-snip0": {"id": "conv6019_1-snip0", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah, yeah.
