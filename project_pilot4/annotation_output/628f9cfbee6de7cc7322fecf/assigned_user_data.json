So, one of the other doctors just gives a lower dose of the chemo, and, uh, like, like, okay, but I would rather make sure you get a full dose of chemo, a full dose of hormones, and if I just space it out a little bit, then we can probably keep that safe.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, space it out a little bit, and I grabbed the number third of January, just outta the air.
