It's the first time we've done it for this chemo. But like, there's an all time chemotherapy called FIVFU, that they made a pill version of that called Xeloda. So that's an active practice if you have like colon cancer, it's just not something we routinely use for prostate, but the idea has been around so it's not super novel, but we've never done it for this type of chemotherapy.

So there's a lot of that and the more complicated we get with our treatments, the worse that occurs.

My heel on my left side was having a lot of pain that I think I had shared, and, uh, I still have some if I go and overdo it, but other than that, no, my shoulders every now and then. My biggest challenge now is, is getting a good night’s sleep.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And that’s because I’ve tried a number of different ways on how to sleep in the bed. I, I have these pillows that I prop up with a long pillow there, to try to lean up against the back of it so, I, you know, my back is up against the pillow. It works some nights. Some nights it doesn’t work.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.

And, uh, just trying to get in a place where you feel like this is where I need to be at, I’m happy here. So, uh, uh, one of the best sleeping place, and I hate to say it, is my living room downstairs on the couch. I prop the pillows up, and, uh, and got my favorite space, so when I lay down and put my back up right up against the back of it, but I don’t want to be in the business of sleeping on my living room couch every night, either. We have a sleep number bed that we purchased just for this, but, uh, uh, I wouldn’t recommend sleep number being if that’s what you’re going, you’re going to use it for, because it’s not all it’s, it’s cut out to be. You’re paying a lot of money for a bed. And sometimes it works, sometimes it don’t. So my biggest challenge each night is to figure out, okay, what’s going to work tonight?

Uh, just as long as I don’t overexert myself. And that’s one of the biggest things, that, you know, you’re feeling good. And you said, okay, I’m going to do a little extra today, and that may be a no-no. You know?  So I, you know, even at my church, I got up and, uh, I think that was two Sundays ago or three Sundays ago, and, uh, I stayed up too long and I preached too hard. And I paid for it the next twenty-four hours of doing it. I should have just cut it short. So what I do now, is like last week, they had church conference meeting.

Because it’s like I will drive to go up. Really it’s an hour and fifteen minutes and an hour and fifteen minutes to go back. Uh, it’s a long day. And that’s a lot to be in that car. So, uh, I learned the hard way. So, uh, my plan now is always to use them if I have to, uh, but, uh, I can’t overdo it because I’ll pay for it the next, the next day. It comes back on me.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So there’s a bit of a disconnect in terms of some of the things that we’re seeing and, and some of the ways that you’re feeling. And I’m not a hundred percent sure like in my own mind whether this drug is working or not. That’s why I asked you what you’ve been thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the parts of me that make me think that it’s not working as well as we expected it is that the PSA level continues to increase.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, we’ve probably told you this before including me, myself, telling you this. That when you are taking an experimental drug, that’s not a hormonal therapy, in this case it’s . Uh, just because the PSA is going up, doesn’t necessarily mean the drug is not working, although when the PSA is dropping, we certainly always interpret that as a good sign.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And, and your PSA over the last three months has continued to go up. Uh, and so that’s one thing. Uh, on the other hand, you know, the scan that you had on August the first and August the second showed that the cancer seems to be relatively stable. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The thing that has concerned us before was that you were getting this sort of worsening bone pain in the left thigh bone and the lower spine and the left ribcage, which sounds like you’re still having those to some degree. They don’t sound as constant.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip5", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: If it does not work. But, at the same time, I think you have to give the, uh, the drug the opportunity – to work.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And that’s why initially when we started, and, uh, and L___, she said, well, Mr. S___, you have the clinical trial. And I believe we’ve, we’ve had, we took the clinical trial. I knew that the doses that I was going to have was, was in a low dosage, and I know it’s going to have some effect there. So my thing is, D___, deal with it as long as you can. So I did. We lowered it down. I have felt changes. I used to have pain, uh, running down this area. I mean serious pain. My back, wherever I used to have pain here, and, uh, I don’t have it anymore. Now, yes, she does rub me down every night. I take two hot, uh, uh, baths each day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Uh, I take those hot baths because when I stiffen up or, and, uh, I kind of said, okay, I need to get in the tub. I put some Epsom salt sitting in, and I sit in the tub about fifteen minutes, and then I get back out. And I said, okay, I can deal with another day. So, again, from my perspective, is that I wanted to see the drug do what it needs to do. I don’t know what the window is. I’m not a medical professional, whatever, so I don’t know that. But I do know that I have seen, uh, uh, changes taking place. I do know that even now I could go and walk around this block. Uh, I shouldn’t, but I probably could. So, uh, the sleeping part, the OxyContin sometimes works, uh, when I take it and I go to sleep. But during the daytime while you’re at work, I normally, I can’t do what I used to do, but I can get along pretty good. We’re talking about at night. We’re talking about at night. And I’m trying to get comfortable in the bed. I wish I could sleep on my stomach but I haven’t figured out a way of, uh, sleeping back on my stomach like I used to. Uh, I just don’t feel comfortable when I sleep on my stomach. So, I’m not, uh, disagreeing with what you said your observations are, uh, but, I’m trying to work with the, with the prescription that we’re taking already. And I didn’t think it was going to be easy. If it was going to be easy, uh, this drug probably would have been FDA approved a long time ago, if it was going to be easy. You know?  It may not work. But, again, you never know. We were off of it for, uh, I think three weeks.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three weeks.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Three weeks. And then I got a call from two doctors. I don’t even remember where their office is. And they said that, uh, my cancer had stabilized.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But they didn’t explain to me what that meant. So what do you mean, stabilized?  Does that mean that it’s not growing?  Does it mean that it’s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it’s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn’t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I’ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you’re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that’s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you’re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let’s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that’s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we’re going to have two more PSAs.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: To see if that’s stabilizing at all. And we’re going to know also from you how you’re feeling in terms of your bone pain. Like, is it overall getting slightly worse over time or if that’s stabilized, or is it perhaps improving?</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5079_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In order to keep you on this study, uh, from the side effect perspective, we’re going to need to temporarily stop the medication again, unfortunately- Because of this hemoglobin being eight point nine. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it’s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose. It’ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don’t think you’ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we’re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we’re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.

Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Does he go in for another blood transfusion or are you expecting the hemoglobin to increase pretty much on its own as he regulates without the medication?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One idea would be to check a hemoglobin level at a local laboratory, uh, one week from now just to see where we are at. And if it has made significant progress on its own, we can skip the blood transfusion. And if it looks like it’s only gone up like one-tenth of a point, then we can perhaps schedule a blood transfusion before September fifth.

Okay. Okay. Okay. And, again, that’s one of the reasons why I wanted to come here, uh, uh, from the um perspective of the options.

But you know in terms of how much does that occur, it’s very rare. Could it occur—sure, and I tend to see it in folks who have had a lot of therapy, especially chemo. You’ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I’m not saying that you couldn’t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it’s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that’s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it’s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you’ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I’ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut. So diarrhea, stomach upset, not so much nausea and vomiting but just more like you know you’ve got the poops kind of thing. But for you it’s obviously something we could regulate because you could get Imodium, you know. You could get treatment. A lot of my patients have it during the time around you know the week that you get injected and then nothing else. So that’s kind of where it is. Oh, and if you have cancer that’s not in the bone, like liver or lungs, which you don’t have, but those patients, they don’t; you know they shouldn’t be treated with this medicine because that medicine that I’m thinking about for you is only for bone. So it will not go to liver or anywhere else.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So the pain that he’s having -</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Is in bone.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: And how big of a spot does he have there – on his hip and lower leg, upper leg.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, I mean it’s not a humongous spot.

At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board.

So, it’s actually a higher chance that they inherit it because it’s --- I, I forgot this is what’s called – so there’s two kinds of mutations; dominant and recessive. So, recessive means you have to, uh, uh, get, uh, two bad copies to – I want to say it’s a twenty-five percent chance because you have to get two bad copies.

So in other words, you can think of it as a three-headed coin, there’s a one out of three chance that you’re gonna get the observation group. That’s about a thirty-three percent chance.

Where did you say it went?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I have to remind myself which side it’s on.

Well, the sheer fact that you are actually asking me that tells me that you don't have many symptoms, because people who have the symptoms, be it bone pain or just extreme fatigue or weight Loss, no appetite will tell me, “Oh man, look at all these things happening to me is because of my cancer?” So when you're curious, that means like, okay, none of this stuff is happening, which is great, but you worry about it because you think this is it, I'm gonna get bone pain. And this is it. You know, that's not the case. If you have pain in the bone, there are medicines to help or more importantly, there are techniques like radiation to help and there are other medicines that we can do to and other strategies to help the pain go away.

So, when I sent you over for like additional, you know, trials you had areas to measure outside your bone but then you kind of don’t. So, on your last CAT scan we couldn’t see anything where the liver was so that’s just not there, the lymph nodes kind of where the adrenal area was is enlarged so you don’t fit that.

So, like you should get a bone scan because the last time was July and we’re in October. You’re in pain so maybe I got to look for new spots that we have to try to treat. That’s one. Then, you know, a bone scan and then a CAT scan, but one that also includes the chest to make sure I’m not missing anything up higher that maybe is causing some of the lower pain.

We’ll, we’ll check you out for that. You know?  You’re here because when Dr. S___, he did the lung biopsy or at least he told those guys to do a lung biopsy, it shows prostate cancer in your lungs. So not lung cancer. So in some sense a little bit of a relief but you still have your cancer of the –</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Of the prostate.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: - prostate in your lungs. Now, you had that in twenty sixteen. It’s just that there’s more of it and slightly bigger. So that’s why I got you. When I went to, I sent you to Dr. S___, it was like well what are we going to do?  Well, I need to take a sample. So he thought about going down this way. If you remember to try to get a sample from that, but he thought getting it through the outside would be just fine.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm, hmm.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Which way did it get it?

It’s just you were delayed a little bit on one day, one of them, and now it’s you need another medicine.

Uh, they’re four pills once a day, and their primary goal of how they work is it’s, it’s like a big hormone pill again. So it’s to help your shot work better. It also is approved by the FDA because it helps you live longer. No cures. Same as we were before but we need to get a handle on all these things in the lung. In the same way, you’re also a candidate for chemo to tell you the truth. Uh, so chemo’s in the mix as well, but the majority of folks I think, and I’m not saying you do, but my patients tend to prefer pills before going on to chemotherapy, and I think way back when we initially again reconnected you were not in so much favor of chemo, uh, as he’s already shaking his head, but I want to bring that up again because at some point we may need to go to chemo. So I want to put that out there still.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but we do have a set of pills. Now, the good news is every time there’s an approved medication, you know, we’re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you’d respond better. So I like that study because it’s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you’re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I’m not sure if that makes sense or if you’ve got questions with that, but we’re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that’s in the works for us to consider. The other part is either way, however we move forward, there’s another study, which is a registry study, called, Iron Man. Uh, not that you become iron man-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that all your experiences as to what’s happened to you get captured. And that means you write out and answer questionnaires. I write out and answer questionnaires. Uh, and then about once a year we take some blood to see what’s happening uh in terms of new research. Uh, and that participation’s pretty cool because a lot of other men around the world are, are participating. And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone’s experience will be captured. And they’re all like you, in the same boat. So we hope you consider that as well. Uh, but I think what we might do is workup to make sure that you’re eligible for all that stuff. I want to introduce you to M___, who’s our research nurse, uh, who just wants to say hi, and then I think we’ll have you come back in a couple weeks when you feel like you’re a little bit stronger.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: How, how long have you been home now?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Two days or-</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Three days.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: From S___’s.

Huh, your testosterone says you have no testosterone.  So the medicines we’ve been giving you are doing their job.  Then your PSA has changed.  Huh, it was twenty three months ago, twenty-eight when I saw you four weeks ago, and now it’s thirty-nine.  Let’s see what we have for scans.  I’ll look at your brain.  Your brain looks fine.  Now to this MRI.  Really they don’t talk much about your bones.  That’s good.  Huh, let’s see.  Your bone scan.

Huh, you know, get you off these pills and maybe go to chemotherapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, chemotherapy’s got about a one in two chance of helping the pain.  Huh, we could always radiate your bones if the pain doesn’t get better with the chemo.

Huh, so normally what you would end up doing is stopping the four pills.  You can stop that.  The prednisone you would stay on because we need it for the chemotherapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, I think last time we talked a little bit about we have one clinical trial where we are giving men chemotherapy.  Huh, that’s the standard.  Huh, and then we, huh, ask men to participate and also getting vitamin C.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That’s the experimental part.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5080_1-snip9", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Because most of what we’re looking for is how you feel.

Huh, you know, there is some flexibility.  They want you here at least twice a week.  But you know, if you’re going to go on holiday or something, you know, we can switch it.  Huh, so far we know that giving high doses of vitamin C is safe.  Huh, we haven’t seen many real extra side effects.  But we don’t know the end of the answer.  Does it help with side effects?  Does it help activity?  Or is there no difference?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so you would be potentially eligible for that.  Huh, if you do a clinical trial, it does slow down a little bit when we get started.  Okay?  Huh, because we would first want to check your insurance company that they will pay for the clinical trial.  You’re not on Medicare yet.  You’re not sixty-five.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so we’d have to check with your insurance.  Do they cover clinical trials, if you’re interested?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, if they are.  Then in the forms that we give them and give you, it tells them, huh, what they’re paying for, and it tells you what we’re going to pay for.  So definitely the dummy vitamin C or the real vitamin C we pay for because that’s experimental.  Your insurance company may have to pay for the time in the chair to get the medicine.  Okay?  Huh, if you have to pay five dollars every time you come into this building, huh, this study could cost you more money because you’re here more often.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, but if you don’t have a copay for visits, then that’s, you know.  So there are some hidden costs.  You know?  If you’re coming in more often and you have to pay for parking and, you know, those sorts of things, huh, we do have the ability for some of our studies to pay for your parking.  We do.

Huh, seventy-five percent of the time you lose your hair, it grows back.  Huh, you might get excess tearing because it can block the tear ducts.  So a little bit.  The other reason why we might want to wait a little bit is just to see how much your palsy is going to get better.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, huh, it drops blood counts.  So right now your white count’s good.  Your platelets are good.  Huh, but we may need to give you a blood transfusion if we make you more anemic.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, huh, we can drop your blood count, white count, and so you might get a higher risk of infection.  Huh, usually we know about that.  We tell you to be careful.  Sometimes we give you antibiotics.  And if it happens every time, sometimes we’re going to give you a medicine that’s going to bring up your white count so it doesn’t drop.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Typically, we don’t use that medicine unless it drops.  Huh, over the long haul, you might get, huh, injury to the longest nerves in your body.  Those are your fingertips and to your toes.  Huh, you get numbness.  Huh, so we try to go out as many as ten cycles.  Most people notice it by the sixth or seventh.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But I’m going to ask you every time can you zip up your thing?  Can you button your pants?  Can you button your shirt?  If you tell me I can’t, I’m going to stop.  Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But if your shirt’s coming in and it’s unbuttoned, even though you tell me you did, I’m not going to believe you.

Because I don’t want to go too far with the numbness, huh, if that’s a possibility.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One of the things about the positive thing about the vitamin C is there is some bit of the people get less numbness. Huh, normally after three or four doses of the chemotherapy, huh, we have a sense of whether it’s helping.  Your PSA may be lower.  Your pain may be better.  Huh, huh, those are sort of some of the clues.  Okay?  Huh, if we feel like it’s, you are getting better, we’re going to keep going as far as ten treatments.  Huh, if after three or four doses, your pain’s worse, your PSA is higher, huh, I might even get scans after the fourth cycle to follow your lymph nodes.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, because if your PSA is going up, and your lymph nodes are getting bigger, we’re not going to keep giving you the chemotherapy if it’s causing all those side effects.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So we’ll check probably after about twelve weeks, huh, about how it’s going.  Huh, but our job will be to cheer lead you through the first three to four cycles, huh, adjusting the dose if you’re having side effects and they’re too severe.  But most people are able to get through it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so my recommendation is that we stop the abiraterone, continue the prednisone.

So that is something of course the blood counts will be monitored anyway. Besides that kidney function, liver function, all that will also be monitored and checked.

That, you got radiation for back in 2007 because usually, when prostate cancer recurs, it first recurs near the prostate. Am I making sense so far?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan. So that's a CT or CAT scan or the bone scan because prostate cancer goes to the bone. So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm. DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows…so here are the, this is the summary. I’ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence. So when you look in the full report, what they say is that there is a it's less than once every here is 0.7 by 0.9 centimeters, so then that's like less than one centimeter. So when it's that small, it's like, really difficult. It's actually like impossible to characterize it to say like, yes, this is definitively cancer or this is not cancer.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that's why it says maybe, but they don't- notably, they don't see any anywhere else, okay. So then today you had your bone scan and the bone scans in shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Okay so these are your two summaries.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So this is CT scan and this is bone scan. Okay. So those are you for your information. So with, with that you really fit into the bucket of what we consider biochemical recurrence.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, which is good. Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip3", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, and then starting treatment when you just when you develop metastatic disease. Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it’s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you get it for two shots and then you stop. What this medicine does is it makes your testosterone levels go to zero. So it works on your testicles which produce the testosterone and it makes them stop producing testosterone. So people have like menopause type symptoms. Mm?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So you’re going to use Lupron?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes, exactly.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So we use Lupron</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Shots?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Mhm. So people get hot flashes. People get low libido, can have erectile dysfunction. And sometimes your testicles will actually get smaller. People can feel more fatigued you sometimes get some weight gain. There can be some cardiovascular like, um like changes in your cholesterol. Let me remind myself though, what other medicines are you on now?</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Cinepro for high blood pressure. Cinepro 1800.

What we found is that there are probably people with a certain genotype, meaning that certain changes in their DNA, which are like totally normal, about a quarter of the population has this.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Those people are more likely to respond, it seems. So with this trial is first we check your genotype. So that's step one. And then if you are the particular genotype, which, for the purposes of we'll just call it AA.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That means that you're eligible for the study-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: -and then you get randomized to the muscadine grape skin or placebo. And if you are on the placebo arm, if your PSA, if it's if the placebo is not working, then you get the muscadine grapeseed. Okay, so, eventually everybody on the trial can get the therapy. Okay? If you're not this genotype and you're not eligible because we don't think that you'll, you'd have any benefit.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But to see if you would be eligible for the study, you'd have to first join the study, then we do this genotype testing. And then if you're eligible, about 25% of the population is eligible. So you have a one in four shot.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then if you're eligible, I think that that would actually be a reasonable option. Okay. The other trial is a trial of alaparib. This study is, a study of, it, so it's a PARP inhibitor. This medicine is used in breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and it's used sometimes in advanced prostate cancer, and we're studying to see if it can be used early on without hormone therapy in prostate cancer. Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower. This is like an expensive medicine that is provided but usually you have to go through insurance for all the clinical trials. So this and this one, I'm not positive that you're eligible for yet either. Okay. So those are the two clinical trial options that we have for biochemical recurrence.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6008_1-snip7", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That’s different than this.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, because this this genotype that we're looking for- it does not predispose you to cancer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This is something that's very common in the population.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We just think that these people are more likely to respond to antioxidants.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But the, yeah, so the, I can print this out for you too, just so that you have it for your records. The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you’re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later.

What will they do?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you come back every month, and we’ll see you initially- you report any side effects. And the way that this usually works is that well, for any treatment, we continue the treatment until either disease progression, meaning that your disease is getting worse despite the treatments of the treatments not working anymore, or unacceptable toxicity.

Okay. I don’t think I’m going to recommend that for you right now because your symptoms seem to be relatively mild. I’m not fully convinced to whether the pain that you had yesterday was attracted to cancer or could’ve been through something . I’ll try this route</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The chemotherapy has a name. It’s called Docetaxel and it has a second name and that is Taxotere. And this is given through the vein, intravenous, also called I.V. Intravenous I.V. It’s given once every few weeks. And I’m writing this down as an option just so you know what we talked about. But at this point in time, um I think that your cancer is progressing relatively slowly, if at all. Probably at slowly. And I don’t see any immediate need right now to recommend the chemotherapy. But it is an option, we’ll save that for later. I wanna focus our conversation now on the fresh option, which is the Xtandi. So in general in patients who have previously received Abiraterone, that could’ve been you, you would’ve been taking it but you were unable to get access to it for the last two months.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: If if that is no longer affected then the second drug, Xtandi, uh typically works for about six, sometimes nine months. So it, it doesn’t work for years and years but it does give us a little bit more time before we have to recommend the chemotherapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One of the things we have been interested in is how do we make this drug work better and longer. Okay. And one way to make this drug better, work better and longer is to try to combine it with a second drug that’s experimental. Okay. So the Xtandi itself is not experimental, this has been approved by the FDA more than five years ago. It’s standard, does not require you to participate in a clinical trial and I could just write you a prescription for this medication. The experimental clinical trial that we’re doing which is research, so you would have to sign a permission slip which we call a consent form. Not today but after we’ve had time to look at it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um and I’ll just flip the page to the back. Okay. It’s a randomized trial. What does randomized mean? Randomized means that at the beginning of the study we flip a coin. Might sound crazy.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I’m going to write randomized. And that coin flip is random. In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can’t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can’t flip it again. We can’t keep flipping it until we get the one that we want.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv6019_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So in this study there are two options. One option is patients get the Xtandi. That’s the same thing that I’ve written on the the top of this page.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It’s called G__?___. And this second drug has been shown in the laboratory, not yet in patients but in the laboratory, that makes the Xtandi work better and longer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And one of the things that this drug does, although it does many other things as well, is that it can boost the immune system. So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person’s body, is because the immune system isn’t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi. Now, I didn’t mention this before but this medication is also a pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So it’s a question of taking two pills versus one pill. Okay. There’s a forty percent chance that the coin will flip coin will flip in that direction and you will be selected to take only the Xtandi.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And there’s a sixty percent chance that the coin will flip and you will get selected to receive the combination, the FDA approved drug plus the experimental drug.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This is not a drug that even if I really wanted you to get on this group, I could just prescribe. Because not been FDA approved for any cancer type, um certainly not for prostate cancer. Um, but the thing that I always want people to understand, when it comes to this clinical trial is, that if you decide you you want to participate in it, you need to conscious of both scenarios.

The the good thing about this trial I did not mention, I think I should, um there’s no placebo involved. So there are some studies where they give people um a sugar pill or basically inactive medication. This trial does not involve a placebo.
