Number one would be switching from that pill to a different pill. And the second pill is called Xtandi.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That is also known as Enzalutamide. Got a long name. The short name is Xtandi, the long name is Enzalutamide. And this is a pill you take it every day and it\u2019s also four pills at a time. Four pills all at once. The dose is one hundred sixty milligrams. So it\u2019s a little bit different from the Abiraterone. And this one does not require Prednisone, no Prednisone for this one. So it\u2019s one less thing to take.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second option for some patients, whose cancer is progressing more rapidly, especially in those that its causing symptoms, like bone pain for example.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Be to go to a intravenous chemotherapy. Okay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to recommend that for you right now because your symptoms seem to be relatively mild. I\u2019m not fully convinced to whether the pain that you had yesterday was attracted to cancer or could\u2019ve been through something . I\u2019ll try this route</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The chemotherapy has a name. It\u2019s called Docetaxel and it has a second name and that is Taxotere. And this is given through the vein, intravenous, also called I.V. Intravenous I.V. It\u2019s given once every few weeks. And I\u2019m writing this down as an option just so you know what we talked about. But at this point in time, um I think that your cancer is progressing relatively slowly, if at all. Probably at slowly. And I don\u2019t see any immediate need right now to recommend the chemotherapy. But it is an option, we\u2019ll save that for later. I wanna focus our conversation now on the fresh option, which is the Xtandi. So in general in patients who have previously received Abiraterone, that could\u2019ve been you, you would\u2019ve been taking it but you were unable to get access to it for the last two months.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: If if that is no longer affected then the second drug, Xtandi, uh typically works for about six, sometimes nine months. So it, it doesn\u2019t work for years and years but it does give us a little bit more time before we have to recommend the chemotherapy.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "very", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_warm": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 56s "}}
