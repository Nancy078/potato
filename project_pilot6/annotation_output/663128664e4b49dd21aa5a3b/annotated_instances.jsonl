Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it\u2019s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose. It\u2019ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we\u2019re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we\u2019re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum. Okay.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So between now and September fifth, a week-?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That\u2019s, that\u2019s two weeks. Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Does he go in for another blood transfusion or are you expecting the hemoglobin to increase pretty much on its own as he regulates without the medication?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One idea would be to check a hemoglobin level at a local laboratory, uh, one week from now just to see where we are at. And if it has made significant progress on its own, we can skip the blood transfusion. And if it looks like it\u2019s only gone up like one-tenth of a point, then we can perhaps schedule a blood transfusion before September fifth. So if you agree to that, I can give you, uh, a prescription for a complete blood count.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 48s "}}
