That\u2019s what I had before.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that\u2019s what happened when I talked to your doctor. They were for sure about pneumonia. They were waiting on the flu results at the time. But I think they treated you like you had the flu, anyway, so. Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right. That\u2019s like I had before. It crippled me.

Uh, the bad part of it is, you know, it\u2019s hard to kind of get a good sense of how things work in the bone because the scans we do are, uh, mostly telling us new spots in the bone. But they, we can\u2019t really measure things getting bigger or smaller.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So often we think of bone as being, we have this sort of feeling that bone is worse, but mostly because we just have trouble imaging and seeing how it changes. So, uh, but it also affects some of the trials we have because those trials require biopsies of tumor tissue, and it\u2019s really hard to get tumor tissue from the bone.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So it may alter what we can do in terms of trials.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So today, I thought we could talk a little bit about kind of what the standard things are to do next, and then we could talk a little bit about some trials that we have.
