We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn\u2019t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It\u2019s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that\u2019s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that\u2019s kind of would be the next treatment that\u2019s standard treatment. It\u2019s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they\u2019re called \u201cPARP\u201d inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations. And, they found that none of the people without the mutations responded. Fourteen of the sixteen - so, you know, ninety percent who had a mutation responded to these drugs very well.

Um.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Am I one of those people?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, you\u2019re one of those people. Now, that drug hasn\u2019t been through the big paces of FDA trial approval. That\u2019s where it is right now. So, the trials we\u2019re looking at are looking at giving that drug alone or in combination with these standard hormones. So, the trial that I would consider for you have multiple arms. We could talk about that in detail, but, it\u2019s there\u2019s two different trials they could either combine the drugs or give you one drug. Um.

So, they do give you a card kind of like when you get a bone scan,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: um humm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: you know, they\u2019re like oh, I just had a bone scan, they\u2019ll be a similar card, but just make sure you travel with that because you\u2019ll set it off. You know, within like a week after you get it, it should be fine</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that\u2019s important to know. I\u2019ll just give you my funny story because my patient when we first started, he was like number one or two and no one was travelling, right, he was like no, I\u2019m not gonna travel. So, now I\u2019m at home and it\u2019s Sunday night and all the sudden my cellphone rings but it\u2019s like nine p.m. and I\u2019m like boy, that\u2019s odd, who would be calling me. Not a number I recognize so I was like uh, do I pick it up, it\u2019s probably a telemarketer, ah, okay. So, I picked it up and it was some guy he was is this Dr. H____? I\u2019m like well, it depends, who wants to know.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah, who wants to</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: He was like well, um, I have a person here who claims to be your patient. I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know where here is, right, but his name is blah, blah, blah. So, the thing is that particular patient we\u2019re always joking around so I\u2019m like is this guy punking me at nine p.m. at night and I was about just this close to going nope, never heard of him, right, but somewhere in the recesses of my mind I\u2019m like maybe this sounds more serious. I go yes and he goes okay, well, anyways we\u2019re at the border patrol.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, wow.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: He set off the sensors. They went on full lock down, like everything,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, geez</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: like guns drawn because they thought he was like transporting plutonium or something.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "not at all", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_warm": "not at all", "pos_empathetic": "not at all", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_info": "not at all", "pos_communicator": "not at all", "pos_agency": "not at all", "pos_support": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
