Now, radium does two things. One is that it helps you live longer but also helps with pain so those people who are, you know, whether you\u2019re taking a Tylenol over-the-counter or you\u2019re taking actual narcotics that should improve.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, you know, all the new studies are like hey, radium and phone a friend, you know, radium and Xtandi, radium and chemo, radium and whatever. So, they\u2019re all in studies but not standard of care yet. I\u2019m gonna pause right there and see how you guys are doing. This is not a test. There\u2019s no test. No test.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay, he was asking when we were waiting for you.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: If the treatment you\u2019re going to give him is going to make him feel better</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: or is he still gonna feel fatigued and miserable.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_info": "slightly", "pos_respect": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 21s "}}

But I agree with you. We should make that decision you know before then.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: We will. I will talk to my wife. As a matter of fact when we leave here I\u2019m going to head to the rehab.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And the four of us can kind of you know talk.
