And the way that this usually works is that well, for any treatment, we continue the treatment until either disease progression, meaning that your disease is getting worse despite the treatments of the treatments not working anymore, or unacceptable toxicity.

You laid down and they beamed it to you, right. This is internal. So when they push it in your bloodstream it goes all around and it lands in the area of the bone that has the cancer.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Is there side effects?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Oh yeah, there’s always side effects. Because it’s radiation, some of the side effects could be you know reduced or lower amounts of blood cells in your system, so people could get low white cells, red cells, platelets. Those are your three guys that I always watch out for and in some people, it’s a pretty big dip and you don’t come back. Very rare, but it’s a possibility.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: What do you mean a dip?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Meaning it destroys too much.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Oh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And there’s no coming back. But you know in terms of how much does that occur, it’s very rare. Could it occur—sure, and I tend to see it in folks who have had a lot of therapy, especially chemo. You’ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I’m not saying that you couldn’t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it’s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that’s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it’s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you’ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I’ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut. So diarrhea, stomach upset, not so much nausea and vomiting but just more like you know you’ve got the poops kind of thing. But for you it’s obviously something we could regulate because you could get Imodium, you know. You could get treatment. A lot of my patients have it during the time around you know the week that you get injected and then nothing else. So that’s kind of where it is. Oh, and if you have cancer that’s not in the bone, like liver or lungs, which you don’t have, but those patients, they don’t; you know they shouldn’t be treated with this medicine because that medicine that I’m thinking about for you is only for bone. So it will not go to liver or anywhere else.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: So the pain that he’s having -</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Is in bone.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: And how big of a spot does he have there – on his hip and lower leg, upper leg.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5022_1-snip11", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm, hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: They’ve had Radium.

(Pause)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I don’t want to compromise your ethical considerations.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, in the realm of standard treatment, the two treatments that we have that are new hormonal treatments, we call them “Second Line Treatments.”  So, the, the Lupron/Eligard is the first one. We would add a second one. Both of those have been tested in big clinical trials, and both of those showed an improvement in survival for a large group of men. It wasn’t a huge improvement. Um. But it reduced your risk of dying of prostate cancer by about thirty percent. The survival improvement was on the order of months, but that is really, uh, for the whole group. It’s hard to call the individuals outta that. Um, so that’s kind of the baseline that we know. Um. And, those drugs, you know, they have side effects that we need to manage, but that’s kind of would be the next treatment that’s standard treatment. It’s approved by the FDA because of the survival improvement. The new finding about this new drug, they’re called “PARP” inhibitors. A group did a study in England where they had fifty guys who had some DNA mutation, mostly BRCA2. They treated the fifty guys; sixteen had mutations. And, they found that none of the people without the mutations responded. Fourteen of the sixteen - so, you know, ninety percent who had a mutation responded to these drugs very well. Suggesting, they’re probably going to work really well in patients like that. Um.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Am I one of those people?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah, you’re one of those people. Now, that drug hasn’t been through the big paces of FDA trial approval. That’s where it is right now. So, the trials we’re looking at are looking at giving that drug alone or in combination with these standard hormones. So, the trial that I would consider for you have multiple arms. We could talk about that in detail, but, it’s there’s two different trials they could either combine the drugs or give you one drug. Um. But, the, but the, where the field is moving is there’s going to be fifty trials of this to try to nail this down.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv5014_1-snip4", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: You know I was reading an article a while back that I like about it’s going to become common for folks to live into their hundreds.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Perhaps.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: The article mentioned about a miracle drug performing.

Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, and then starting treatment when you just when you develop metastatic disease. Option two is what we call intermittent hormone therapy. So, what this approach means is that you would get hormone therapy, which is the primary treatment for prostate cancer. If you were here in this metastatic bucket, you can get started with hormone therapy. But you would get started on hormone therapy for six months and then we stop and then and that'll bring down your PSA and then we wait until some threshold PSA, your PSA is about 31 now, so we could wait until it gets to 31 again. And sometimes we wait until it’s 10 sometimes 50, but you know, we would, we would only give you the hormone therapy intermittently, so not continuously so you get it for six months, two shots, shot us for three months, lasts for three months.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you get it for two shots and then you stop.

I was thinking the same thing.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay?  So they will ask you then at our pharmacy, well, can you afford that amount of money, and if you can’t, so they will work to see if there’s grants to see whether they can, the drug companies who make these drugs, can cover the cost that you can’t cover. Okay?  But you have to have Medicare D and all these other things. So it can take a little bit while depending on if they have it. And again, they’re going to do a wallet check to see how much you make to see what they think you can cover.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Well, I’m working.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Well, right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That, that’s just the rules that they’re going to go through.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: I see.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Abiraterone is probably what I would prefer. Although for you, the downsides of it is potentially, you know, fluid retention. Huh, there is a lot of fatigue related to it. Huh, huh, we have to watch your blood tests a little bit. Huh, about seventy-five percent, three out of four people, their PSA is going to drop on it. Huh, the average person’s on it for about fifteen months, then the cancer figures it out, and we have to look at maybe moving to something else. We don’t change therapy based on PSA. We base it on how you’re feeling and whether your scans show more cancer than what we saw today. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Now, what would you recommend right now?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I, I like the abiraterone but we’ll have to check to sort of see what the cost is to you. The other one doesn’t need prednisone. It makes people a little bit more frail so I’m a little bit more worried about that one in you. Huh, you know, we don’t have right offhand a clinical trial that I can think about. Our first study with abiraterone, you have to have a mutation which you don’t have. So we would just be able to give you abiraterone. Our enzalutamide plus new drug first-line study is on hold right now. Huh, the two other studies that we have all require that you have had abiraterone or enzalutamide. Huh, so usually after one of these drugs if your cancer is getting worse more options from a clinical trial perspective open up. Huh, we just finished our study of radiation and a vaccine. We don’t know if that has any activity or working yet to see whether or not, huh, that would be a standard option. Huh, you aren’t eligible, so right now, it would be the abiraterone that we would head towards. So what I typically do is send an email to our pharmacy saying can you price this out, then speak to you about whether you can afford it or not afford it, and then, huh, they work on sort of the patient assistance program, if you need it. Huh, if you don’t need it or you get one of those things, then they can provide the drug. Huh, we might have you come in and meet with that pharmacist or one of the nurse practitioners that I work with, huh, to sort of just re-go over what you may feel with starting the new drug, or that if, again, we just can’t get it for you, we can try the other one, or we would think maybe even going to the radium, which is a liquid radiation drug, which is given here in the clinic.

One is um PSA level has now increased by more than double -</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: - compared to the first one; call that the baseline number. So the trial was designed in such a way - because we don’t want to be giving people an experimental therapy and harming them by delaying improving therapy. So the trial was designed in such a way that it was built with a safety check. And the safety check is if the PSA goes up by twofold, then, in other words, a one hundred percent increase from baseline, then patient will come off study. So you have now crossed that threshold.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Uh hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: A month ago, you hadn’t and now you’ve you’ve crossed that number which I think was twenty-six point seven. So you’re two points above that. The second reason is um having to do with your scans. We have the results of your bone scan and your um CAT scan.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The um the bone scan looks completely unchanged, in other words normal.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So we don’t think there is any evidence or hint that there could be prostate cancer in the bone. And that is really the most important thing; so I wanted to say that first. The second one is the CAT scan. So on the CAT scan, you have a lymph node inside your abdomen -</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv1009_3-snip4", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Which way did it get it?  From the left side or right side?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The biopsy?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Ooh, I want to say left. Uh, I think it was the left, and then they did the special stains underneath the microscope, and, you know, looked for actual prostate stains, and it was positive on both of them. So now the question is, you started your hormone shot back up, and you’ve kind of been on it the whole time. It’s just you were delayed a little bit on one day, one of them, and now it’s you need another medicine. But I want to make sure that you are well healed from your pneumonia before we go ahead and do that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm, hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Probably, you know, another several weeks or so until you feel like you’re back on your feet, uh, and over the flu, the pneumonia, and all that, but we think you’re going to need a set of pills to kind of help keep the prostate in check.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: What kind of pills?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So these are FDA-approved pills called Xtandi, which is the trade name. Uh, they’re four pills once a day, and their primary goal of how they work is it’s, it’s like a big hormone pill again. So it’s to help your shot work better. It also is approved by the FDA because it helps you live longer. No cures. Same as we were before but we need to get a handle on all these things in the lung. In the same way, you’re also a candidate for chemo to tell you the truth. Uh, so chemo’s in the mix as well, but the majority of folks I think, and I’m not saying you do, but my patients tend to prefer pills before going on to chemotherapy, and I think way back when we initially again reconnected you were not in so much favor of chemo, uh, as he’s already shaking his head, but I want to bring that up again because at some point we may need to go to chemo. So I want to put that out there still.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, but we do have a set of pills. Now, the good news is every time there’s an approved medication, you know, we’re at K______, so we do a lot of clinical studies. So one of our studies is to use that same medication and see if we add a second pill to half the group whether you’d respond better. So I like that study because it’s all pills and no one gets a placebo when you’re thinking about the Xtandi pills. Everyone is on the regular pill that is approved. The question of the placebo versus the other drug is extra. Okay?  So I’m not sure if that makes sense or if you’ve got questions with that, but we’re going to try hard to have you be, you know, considered for that study. Uh, I want you to still recover well from your, your hospitalization, but, uh, but that’s in the works for us to consider. The other part is either way, however we move forward, there’s another study, which is a registry study, called, Iron Man. Uh, not that you become iron man-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that all your experiences as to what’s happened to you get captured. And that means you write out and answer questionnaires. I write out and answer questionnaires. Uh, and then about once a year we take some blood to see what’s happening uh in terms of new research. Uh, and that participation’s pretty cool because a lot of other men around the world are, are participating. And so we get answers from guys from Australia, Ireland, uh, you know, England uh, gosh, Canada, France, so all of that. So everyone’s experience will be captured. And they’re all like you, in the same boat. So we hope you consider that as well. Uh, but I think what we might do is workup to make sure that you’re eligible for all that stuff. I want to introduce you to M___, who’s our research nurse, uh, who just wants to say hi, and then I think we’ll have you come back in a couple weeks when you feel like you’re a little bit stronger.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv1070_1-snip0", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I ain’t been doing too bad, I ain’t been doing too good.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.

So, like you should get a bone scan because the last time was July and we’re in October. You’re in pain so maybe I got to look for new spots that we have to try to treat. That’s one. Then, you know, a bone scan and then a CAT scan, but one that also includes the chest to make sure I’m not missing anything up higher that maybe is causing some of the lower pain.

Am I making sense so far?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan. So that's a CT or CAT scan or the bone scan because prostate cancer goes to the bone. So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm. DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows…so here are the, this is the summary. I’ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence.

So with that rise, I got a little worried. Because I don't want the Xtandi to get away from us. At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board. You still with me?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: No, you gotta slow down.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.

So, sometimes the cancer gets smart. And now we say look, maybe there's a way to kind of flap that, see if we can get it to work again, because it did work for a while, which was good. So this pill going right along, we want to add a second pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This study is to add a second pill, different pathway, to say hey, I'm gonna see if I add the second guy whether both together will make your PSA drop. But of course, to make things complicated, the second pill, they want to do stuff too. So they're going to have two groups. So if you're in the first group, you keep going on your Xtandi, and you get the second pill at a particular dose, no problem. Then W____ is on the same study, he's on Xtandi two pills a day. And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill. But his is not an active 40 milligrams, he just gets the sugar version of the 40 milligrams.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>"]}, {"id": "conv1108_1-snip6", "text": ["<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: So did you like Budapest?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes, it was interesting.
