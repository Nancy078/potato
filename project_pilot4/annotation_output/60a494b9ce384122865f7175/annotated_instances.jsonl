If it\u2019s more than bone, meaning, oh, shoot, maybe that thingy in the liver and the lymph nodes and all that is actually there again and that other one was sort of a fake out then I think you need chemo and I think we\u2019ve been stalling enough for a while that the inevitable is about to happen Mr. H____ you just, you\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re just gonna have to do it</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and that\u2019s with docetaxel and Taxotere is the name of the chemo and we do have studies with that so I just, you know, I always want to make sure we talk about that. So, you\u2019d get on Taxotere just alone once every three weeks. It\u2019s an hour infusion. Standard of care anywhere you go in the US.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: and then our studies are Taxotere plus high-dose vitamin C versus just the Taxotere. So, two-thirds of the people will get vitamin C. The other one third will just get the chemo.

So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that\u2019s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you\u2019re just bone. So, let\u2019s say we do this and you\u2019re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it\u2019s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium. So, there it\u2019s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don\u2019t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it\u2019s just in bone.

{"id": "conv5079_1-snip6", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But they didn\u2019t explain to me what that meant. So what do you mean, stabilized?  Does that mean that it\u2019s not growing?  Does it mean that it\u2019s not, uh, progressing?  Does it mean it\u2019s not going the other way?  What, what do you mean, stabilized?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. I think that meant that the, the CT and bone scan from August first and August second did not look any, any worse than the ones before that. They also didn\u2019t look any better but the cancer had stopped growing and spreading further.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yes.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that what, you know, stabilizing means. So I\u2019ve heard everything that you had to say. And it, it seems very clear that you\u2019re leaning towards continuing on the study and I think that\u2019s a reasonable idea. There has been nothing so far on this study that is an absolute reason to stop. An absolute reason to stop would be, for example, if your scans showed unequivocal progression of the cancer. That would be one reason. Another reason would be if your pain was getting so bad that we had to consider radiation to the bone to eliminate the pain. Uh, another would be if you had any, uh, very serious side effect to the medication that is not reversible. Uh, so, what I think we should do is this. It sounds like you want to try to give this a bit more time. I think that about two months from now, roughly, a bit less, because your scans were on August first and second, so, roughly, I think the first week of October, you\u2019re going to be getting another CT scan and another bone scan, because this trial requires the scan every eight weeks. Uh, let\u2019s try to keep you on the study until that point in time because that\u2019s going to give us a lot more information about, you know, comparing that scan to the previous one and then comparing that scan to the very, very first one, your baseline, as we call it. Uh, plus by then, we\u2019re going to have two more PSAs.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: To see if that\u2019s stabilizing at all. And we\u2019re going to know also from you how you\u2019re feeling in terms of your bone pain. Like, is it overall getting slightly worse over time or if that\u2019s stabilized, or is it perhaps improving?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: In order to keep you on this study, uh, from the side effect perspective, we\u2019re going to need to temporarily stop the medication again, unfortunately- Because of this hemoglobin being eight point nine. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it\u2019s very likely that when you come back on September fifth, your hemoglobin will be above nine, hopefully, above ten, it will recover some, in other words, uh, and then given that the hemoglobin has improved, we can put you back on the medication, but it will be at the two-hundred milligram dose. It\u2019ll be a second level of dose reduction. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to go lower than that. Okay?  But I think the two-fifty in terms of the anemia, uh, it did cause the same problem, again, to a lesser degree, but it did still cause the same problem. Uh, so my preference, if you want to remain on the study, which I think is reasonable, would be as of today to ask you to stop the medication until you come back and see us on September the fifth. And on that day, what we\u2019re probably going to recommend, provided that your hemoglobin has increased again, preferably above ten, but at least above nine, is we\u2019re going to put you back on the second dose level reduction which will be two hundred milligrams per day.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "extremely", "pos_competence": "extremely", "pos_warm": "very", "pos_empathetic": "extremely", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "extremely", "pos_agency": "extremely", "pos_support": "extremely"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 26s "}}

{"id": "conv6019_1-snip5", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One of the things we have been interested in is how do we make this drug work better and longer. Okay. And one way to make this drug better, work better and longer is to try to combine it with a second drug that\u2019s experimental. Okay. So the Xtandi itself is not experimental, this has been approved by the FDA more than five years ago. It\u2019s standard, does not require you to participate in a clinical trial and I could just write you a prescription for this medication. The experimental clinical trial that we\u2019re doing which is research, so you would have to sign a permission slip which we call a consent form. Not today but after we\u2019ve had time to look at it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um and I\u2019ll just flip the page to the back. Okay. It\u2019s a randomized trial. What does randomized mean? Randomized means that at the beginning of the study we flip a coin. Might sound crazy.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I\u2019m going to write randomized. And that coin flip is random. In other words, neither the doctor nor the patient can influence it. We can\u2019t rig the system. Once the coin has been flipped, we can\u2019t flip it again. We can\u2019t keep flipping it until we get the one that we want.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So in this study there are two options. One option is patients get the Xtandi. That\u2019s the same thing that I\u2019ve written on the the top of this page.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So option number one is to get the same drug that I would have recommended anyway as part of your standard care. Option number two is the combination of Xtandi plus the new experimental drug, which has a long name. It\u2019s called G__?___. And this second drug has been shown in the laboratory, not yet in patients but in the laboratory, that makes the Xtandi work better and longer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And one of the things that this drug does, although it does many other things as well, is that it can boost the immune system. So one of the reasons why cancer can grow and progress in a person\u2019s body, is because the immune system isn\u2019t able to attack and kill the cancer cells fast enough. And the cancer cells can make some chemicals that can switch off those immune cells. recognizing and killing the cancer. What this drug is it tries to stimulate that immune system again so it can recognize the cancer. But it does that in conjunction with the Xtandi. Now, I didn\u2019t mention this before but this medication is also a pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_warm": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_info": "very", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_support": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 6s "}}
