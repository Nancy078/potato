Just to spare people from prostate cancer. The MAP study, the muscadine grape skin has very few side effects gas, upset stomach, this one can cause nausea and vomiting and can sometimes cause your blood counts to go lower. This is like an expensive medicine that is provided but usually you have to go through insurance for all the clinical trials.
