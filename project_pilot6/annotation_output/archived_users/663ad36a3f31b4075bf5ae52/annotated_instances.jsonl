I get that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second study is chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy versus chemotherapy. So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that\u2019s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you\u2019re just bone. So, let\u2019s say we do this and you\u2019re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it\u2019s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium. So, there it\u2019s um to combine with anything else is not standard of care and we don\u2019t have our trial up yet with radium plus something. But, at this moment standard of care is just monthly radium for six months and that improves your survival span. So does chemotherapy but radium you can only give if it\u2019s just in bone.

Now, radium does two things. One is that it helps you live longer but also helps with pain so those people who are, you know, whether you\u2019re taking a Tylenol over-the-counter or you\u2019re taking actual narcotics that should improve.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "slightly", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_partnership": "slightly", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_info": "slightly", "pos_warm": "not at all"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 25s "}}
