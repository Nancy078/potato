And the way that this usually works is that well, for any treatment, we continue the treatment until either disease progression, meaning that your disease is getting worse despite the treatments of the treatments not working anymore, or unacceptable toxicity.

One, that will allow you to sleep because I think your prostate is acting up, it\u2019s too big which means it\u2019s blocking the way of the pee and then what happens is you pee but there\u2019s stuff left over but your body doesn\u2019t know it until just a little bit more accumulates in there and also your bladder is like oh, I was this full and now I\u2019m this full, okay, I got to pee again and when you\u2019re laying down you pee a lot easier because then your whole body is trying to recalibrate and what\u2019s happening.
