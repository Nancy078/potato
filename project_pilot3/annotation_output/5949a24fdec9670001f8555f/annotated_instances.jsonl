So I said why couldn\u2019t I -I can\u2019t come here. That\u2019s any policy. Any pharmacy you go to that I\u2019ve ever been to, you have to have your ID. Couldn\u2019t anyone come up there and get your stuff. And then I had told them two weeks before.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But you\u2019ve never had ID for a long time and they were doing you a special favor right\u2026</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: No I\u2026</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: \u2026by giving you. Now you have ID.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I\u2019ve been having it, doctor, I\u2019ve been disappointed though uh when I put, two weeks after I put in there do not let anyone come and pick up my medication if it\u2019s not me. Why would you still let somebody pay but they said it was another girl cuz C____ the young lady that said I do know \u2013</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Mmm.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: - said no it wasn\u2019t us. It must have been the girl somebody new but she was at the office where they explained that to her.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright so I\u2019ll you a new script then.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: But anyway\u2026</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And you\u2019re gonna get it filled at H____?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh yeah but anyway, but anyway uh Dr. B____ the, the, the I think he\u2019s short. I can\u2019t think of his name. Anyway, he told me to talk to him. It\u2019s a Chinese guy that that that denied me, but his boss\u2026</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "slightly", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_info": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}

It covers it and it\u2019s gone. But, the TSA sensors are so sensitive that it\u2019s even below the threshold of what the radium is. So, they do give you a card kind of like when you get a bone scan,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: um humm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: you know, they\u2019re like oh, I just had a bone scan, they\u2019ll be a similar card, but just make sure you travel with that because you\u2019ll set it off. You know, within like a week after you get it, it should be fine</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but that\u2019s important to know. I\u2019ll just give you my funny story because my patient when we first started, he was like number one or two and no one was travelling, right, he was like no, I\u2019m not gonna travel. So, now I\u2019m at home and it\u2019s Sunday night and all the sudden my cellphone rings but it\u2019s like nine p.m. and I\u2019m like boy, that\u2019s odd, who would be calling me. Not a number I recognize so I was like uh, do I pick it up, it\u2019s probably a telemarketer, ah, okay. So, I picked it up and it was some guy he was is this Dr. H____? I\u2019m like well, it depends, who wants to know.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah, who wants to</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: He was like well, um, I have a person here who claims to be your patient. I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know where here is, right, but his name is blah, blah, blah. So, the thing is that particular patient we\u2019re always joking around so I\u2019m like is this guy punking me at nine p.m. at night and I was about just this close to going nope, never heard of him, right, but somewhere in the recesses of my mind I\u2019m like maybe this sounds more serious. I go yes and he goes okay, well, anyways we\u2019re at the border patrol.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, wow.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: He set off the sensors. They went on full lock down, like everything,</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, geez</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: like guns drawn because they thought he was like transporting plutonium or something.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "very", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_info": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
