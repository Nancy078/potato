Because they can see uh, what we\u2019re limited by right now is as I told you these lymph nodes are enlarged. That\u2019s pretty much all the radiologist can say right now.

It has to bind in something in the cell called receptors. So the best way to think about it is a ball and glove. Xtandi kind of, if, if the ball is testosterone, Xtandi looks like an orange. And so it gets in the glove, and it blocks the ball. It can\u2019t get in there. Uh, Zytiga works in a different way. It blocks the enzymes that the body uses to make testosterone. So there\u2019s all these different precursors. So start with cholesterol, and it goes through about ten steps, and ends at testosterone. When you block it, there\u2019s some hormones that build up that can affect the kidney.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And those hormones can affect how you handle water and potassium.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So what they found is if you give a little bit of prednisone, which is also kind of a hormone, it balances that out. Uh, so we just give a once-a-day low dose, and that seems to be enough to keep the potassium normal. But some people don\u2019t like prednisone. It makes them feel weird. It makes them gain weight. It makes them eat more.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh. (Laughter)</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And so, uh, the standard dose was twice a day. We found that if we just give it once a day, it\u2019s enough to counterbalance the thing.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, so I think either one would be fine.
