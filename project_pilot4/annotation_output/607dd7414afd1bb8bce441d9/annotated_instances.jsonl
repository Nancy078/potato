{"id": "conv5077_1-snip8", "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, the survival part\u2019s tricky because that\u2019s the whole group, and some of the men, so, you look at the number total, it\u2019s only, you know, a couple of months\u2019 difference between the guys that get the drug and the guys that don\u2019t. But within that group, there are some people that respond really well and really long who probably are getting much more than a couple of months, and there\u2019s some people where it doesn\u2019t do anything, and they\u2019re probably getting nothing out of it. So, uh, the other thing they look at in the trials is something called a, sort of a risk reduction. So there\u2019s pretty significant reduction in dying from prostate cancer if you\u2019re on, if you take the drug. So in my experience, what I\u2019ve seen is about a third of the men I give the drug to, their PSA drops, and they have a really long response that usually long means somewhere between, well, I\u2019ve only been using it, you know, a couple of years now, but two to three years sometimes.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: One, one to three years, maybe, let\u2019s say. Uh, another third of the guys, the PSA drops really nicely, and then starts to go back up usually six months or so, and then the third group of guys, usually the PSA is a readout. It just marches along. In your case, that\u2019s going to be the primary thing for us because the bone, like I said, it\u2019s hard to measure changes.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, uh, and the, the biggest fact from the drug was in men before chemotherapy, it\u2019s probably just because they were earlier in their disease-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not, not that there was anything different before or after. So, uh, the two drugs, about sixty plus percent of men respond overall. So that\u2019s what I said. About two-thirds of the guys respond, and then one-third seems to have a long response, and one-third has a shorter response, and one-third don\u2019t. Uh, in terms of how to pick which one of those two. Uh, for a while, I, I was picking Zytiga instead of Xtandi. Zytiga, the one complication with Zytiga, is you have to take a small dose of prednisone with it, uh, to kind of counterbalance how Zytiga works.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, the one reason we would do that is because we had some trials, uh, that were after Zytiga. But the other reason was a tendency of less fatigue with the Zytiga than the Xtandi, in my experience.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Both drugs can cause fatigue. But it seems to be more common and often a little bit worse with Xtandi. So, uh, in my choosing those two, I have been choosing Zytiga, just for that reason. Uh, but the Xtandi is a little bit easier, because you just have to take Xtandi.
