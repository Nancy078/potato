This is really done with the right, you know, it\u2019s made by a company that\u2019s sort of a spinoff of Hopkins so it\u2019s a very well-regulated product. Um, but, can I tell you that if you\u2019re on placebo you still have to be here?  Yeah, because I don\u2019t know who\u2019s getting what. So, the three of us would be fast friends for weeks. Every day it\u2019d be like hello, hello. Just take your name and tape it on an infusion area and you\u2019ll see M____ and S____ all the time.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and same thing, you know, when you go to the bathroom. It\u2019s the same thing because he doesn\u2019t want to nail you just because you\u2019re sitting next to him it shouldn\u2019t be but, you know, for the younger people or people who are more immunocompromised who are older they get at risk for stuff and we say why bother.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: They won\u2019t put a port in him will they?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, we shouldn\u2019t have to. We shouldn\u2019t have to.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Even though when they get him they go to the Docetaxal?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now, Oh, well, from a chemo standpoint we might have to negotiate that. For sure if you get on the high-dose vitamin C one that is more labor intensive because the chemo is once every three months, not three months, once every three weeks. He got hopeful there for a minute. No, sorry, once every three weeks but the vitamin C is twice a week because it\u2019s at such a high dose.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Oh.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Well, think about normal stuff you would pop every day you\u2019d almost have to take it multiple times a day to get that dose. This would be the super high one so you\u2019re here like twice a week for like weeks and months. I mean we hope it\u2019s that long because that means it\u2019s working, but yeah, that\u2019s a bit of a slightly draining on that one</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: but I have a lot of people who just want their hands on high-dose vitamin C because this is you know, formulated differently than just sort of generic stuff.
