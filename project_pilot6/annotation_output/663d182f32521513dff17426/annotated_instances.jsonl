I get that.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The second study is chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy versus chemotherapy. So, docetaxel plus immunotherapy versus docetaxel. So, you know, either one of those is doable. Again, if you had stuff outside of bone that\u2019s probably what we should do. Hi, oh, for the opioids, Okay, for your pain, yeah. So, then the other part is what if you\u2019re just bone. So, let\u2019s say we do this and you\u2019re just in your bones, no lymph nodes, liver, nothing, it\u2019s clean then I think we should consider radium or Xofigo.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Together with the docetaxel?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: No, just radium.
