So with that rise, I got a little worried. Because I don't want the Xtandi to get away from us. At that point, there was a study and there still is, where people on Xtandi if they start to do this with their PSA, might be eligible to add another pill right on to that. So you still stay on Xtandi. But this other pill might make the Xtandi sort of work better. And, you know, if you were on full dose, you'd be eligible, if you were on three pills, as well as just the two pills a day is still an option. So initially, we weren't sure if it was going to open because this was a study that had a sugar pill arm that I wasn't too keen on. But with this new, kind of like update, everybody gets the pill. So this is where the study is. So here you are in your Xtandi. Xtandi, Xtandi, Xtandi. And then you get randomized. So flip of a coin to either get this new medicine at a certain dose, or this new medicine at the same dose. Okay, so so far, both arms are the same, you just get a new medicine at the same dose, okay, no placebo. This arm is going to keep you like that, so you take the Xtandi plus the new pill at the new dose, no problem, you're just on that. This arm is you on Xtandi plus the new pill, but every month, they're going to try to increase that dose gently. So you get another pill that has more milligrams in it. While that's happening, if you were on this arm, you get a matching placebo. So you do get a sugar pill, but that's in addition to the new pill already being on board. You still with me?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: No, you gotta slow down.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Do you want me to say it again?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Try me again.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, no worries.

So, sometimes the cancer gets smart. And now we say look, maybe there's a way to kind of flap that, see if we can get it to work again, because it did work for a while, which was good. So this pill going right along, we want to add a second pill.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: This study is to add a second pill, different pathway, to say hey, I'm gonna see if I add the second guy whether both together will make your PSA drop. But of course, to make things complicated, the second pill, they want to do stuff too. So they're going to have two groups. So if you're in the first group, you keep going on your Xtandi, and you get the second pill at a particular dose, no problem. Then W____ is on the same study, he's on Xtandi two pills a day. And I give him also the second pill at the same dose. Nobody's placebo-ing, you're now on two potentially active medicines, okay. But to make the study even more interesting, what they're doing is, if you are doing okay, on those two doses, they're going to give you an extra, you know, like 40 milligrams every month to see if they can increase that dose to get better mileage on this activity. But W____ is going to also get a matching pill.
