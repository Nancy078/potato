Things that we\u2019re going to be testing.  So then we can sort of compare what blood test and symptoms are for those who actually get the vitamin C versus those who don\u2019t.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So you have a fifty-fifty chance that you\u2019re going to get the real stuff.  Huh, you know, there is some flexibility.  They want you here at least twice a week.  But you know, if you\u2019re going to go on holiday or something, you know, we can switch it.  Huh, so far we know that giving high doses of vitamin C is safe.  Huh, we haven\u2019t seen many real extra side effects.  But we don\u2019t know the end of the answer.  Does it help with side effects?  Does it help activity?  Or is there no difference?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so you would be potentially eligible for that.  Huh, if you do a clinical trial, it does slow down a little bit when we get started.  Okay?

You\u2019re not sixty-five.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so we\u2019d have to check with your insurance.

Then in the forms that we give them and give you, it tells them, huh, what they\u2019re paying for, and it tells you what we\u2019re going to pay for.  So definitely the dummy vitamin C or the real vitamin C we pay for because that\u2019s experimental.  Your insurance company may have to pay for the time in the chair to get the medicine.  Okay?
