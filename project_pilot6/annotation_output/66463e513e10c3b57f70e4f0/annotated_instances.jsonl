And so that\u2019s why I put this appointment on the books. So let\u2019s get the hormones started. You know you will say, \u201cI want it; I don\u2019t want it; I do want it.\u201d In other words I\u2019m not trying to put, you know but we have to have and then your opinion back.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So we weren\u2019t making any decisions.

And then if you\u2019re still interested, then we would go for it. If you say, \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d, if you\u2019re not interested then you have to think about when do we start you know the chemotherapy. And that\u2019s what we would probably do anyway. If you go through the process about the trial and they say you\u2019re not eligible, then we would give the chemo anyway.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah anyway.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Now, at the end of the trial catheter, how do they go uh with that? Do they have to wait for the catheter to come out in order start clinical trials or or,</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That\u2019s after you\u2019ve sat down with D and signed the paperwork.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Then they\u2019ll do the extra tests to see that you\u2019re eligible.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So there are steps and then if you\u2019re working with a urologist and he or she is able to get it out, that\u2019s great. If they feel like it needs to stay in and that isn\u2019t something that excludes you from the study or that just will tell me that if I\u2019m giving you chemotherapy your blood counts can get low. If your blood counts are low and you\u2019ve got a tube in your bladder, you could have an infection.

The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you\u2019re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later. You know, having talked to you before. I think what we should maybe try and do first is see if you'd be eligible and if you have this genotype for the MAP study.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_support": "very", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very", "pos_warm": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}
