Am I making sense so far?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan.

So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm. DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows\u2026so here are the, this is the summary. I\u2019ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence. So when you look in the full report, what they say is that there is a it's less than once every here is 0.7 by 0.9 centimeters, so then that's like less than one centimeter. So when it's that small, it's like, really difficult. It's actually like impossible to characterize it to say like, yes, this is definitively cancer or this is not cancer.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that's why it says maybe, but they don't- notably, they don't see any anywhere else, okay.

Okay so these are your two summaries.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So this is CT scan and this is bone scan. Okay. So those are you for your information.

Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span>"], "displayed_text": "<span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Okay</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, so that means that because your prostate is out, we know that the PSA is coming from the cancer, but there's not so much of it that we can see it, so it's there somewhere we just don't know exactly where it is.
