Because it\u2019s radiation, some of the side effects could be you know reduced or lower amounts of blood cells in your system, so people could get low white cells, red cells, platelets. Those are your three guys that I always watch out for and in some people, it\u2019s a pretty big dip and you don\u2019t come back.

But you know in terms of how much does that occur, it\u2019s very rare. Could it occur\u2014sure, and I tend to see it in folks who have had a lot of therapy, especially chemo. You\u2019ve had pills and more pills, a little smattering of radiation and a Provenge, and a partridge in a pear tree. So where you are coming in is your bone marrow is not as compromised as a person who had chemo. I\u2019m not saying that you couldn\u2019t get it after chemo, but the perfect person to give it in is a person who is actually having some pain, which you are, a person that otherwise is in good shape, and has a good enough bone marrow reserve, which you do, and it\u2019s not related to any other treatment like steroids and things like that, where if I were to offer chemo, that would be part of the package. Again, not impossible for us to go down the chemo route, but that\u2019s also the next discussion. But for this, I think it\u2019s reasonable to talk to the radiation doctor about it because you\u2019ll want to know pros and cons. So the bone marrow is the thing I always worry about, but for my other patients, and I\u2019ve had many go through it, the other part that it could affect would be your gut. So diarrhea, stomach upset, not so much nausea and vomiting but just more like you know you\u2019ve got the poops kind of thing. But for you it\u2019s obviously something we could regulate because you could get Imodium, you know. You could get treatment. A lot of my patients have it during the time around you know the week that you get injected and then nothing else. So that\u2019s kind of where it is. Oh, and if you have cancer that\u2019s not in the bone, like liver or lungs, which you don\u2019t have, but those patients, they don\u2019t; you know they shouldn\u2019t be treated with this medicine because that medicine that I\u2019m thinking about for you is only for bone.
