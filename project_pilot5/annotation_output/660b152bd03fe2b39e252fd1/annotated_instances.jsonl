I mean, the assumption is that it is prostate cancer. Why give him a second cancer?  Uh. So, that\u2019s the assumption. You know, the adrenal gland can have benign tumors in it. Okay?  Um.

I would gradually reintroduce them if I was you.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yes. I agree with you.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: And I also had a question about that proton treatment that they have in B___.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yeah. Yeah.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not ah truly applicable to you at this point. That\u2019s great for if you were just newly diagnosed with your prostate cancer or if you have some specific area on your spine. You obviously just got the radiation to there but if you know you\u2019re a baby, for example, and you had a really tiny spinal cord, and you have this cancer next to it, a proton would be the perfect treatment. For adults, it\u2019s a little harder to know what is better than the standard. So you know you hope maybe if you got protons you wouldn\u2019t have had so many side effects. That\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s not as mainstream I think as we\u2019d like to see it. At some point now when they\u2019re really up and running and more patients will get experience, we\u2019ll probably get a better sense of that.

The radiation you got is still image guided. It\u2019s still blocked off. So those studies are ongoing. And that\u2019s why not every center and not every state has protons.

And you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better. So this issue comes around a lot because of prostate. So protons wanted to replace, you know, oh, and I going to save the bladder or anything else. And that data doesn\u2019t show it to be better necessarily. So it\u2019s a big fight between the radiation guys. They\u2019re trying to figure that out themselves. Um, but I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s good technology. So I think if needed, if it was a really tough spot or really small area I think it\u2019s reasonable.

But I feel like, um, D___ is in pain often, and, um, it\u2019s, I would say the past two weeks, I would say like maybe last week, maybe a week and a half ago, he was in a lot of pain and very weak, from my perspective, what I am seeing. And, um, so often, and often would mean almost nightly, I am rubbing him with either Salonpas or Aspercreme or Bengay, one of the three, on his back, shoulders, legs, so that he can feel comfortable enough so he can lay down and rest. So, you know, that\u2019s how I see it. I don\u2019t know if he feels, if maybe I\u2019m interpreting his pain to be more than it is, but when he asks me to rub, you know, rub something on his back, in my mind it\u2019s pain. When I look at his face, I see that he\u2019s in pain. So that\u2019s what I see. And, you know, it might be that he\u2019s like no, P___, it\u2019s not that bad. On a scale of one to ten, it might be seven, but when I look at him, I\u2019m seeing eight, nine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: We\u2019ve got a thing to keep in mind is in your case we decided to try this study because of the genetic mutations that your tumor had.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Uh, it wasn\u2019t that we tried this study because you had exhausted all other options.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the reason we\u2019re saying that is because there are other things out there that your cancer has a good chance of responding well to. For example, uh, the alternative hormone therapy called Xtandi, that you have not received. You have received the one called, Zytiga. But there\u2019s a similar one that was FDA approved about a year after the Zytiga was approved, called Xtandi. And it\u2019s an oral hormone therapy pill. That medication does not work that well after people have received Zytiga first because it\u2019s similarly related to that drug, but that\u2019s an option. The second option is intravenous chemotherapy, which you have also not received. Um, which I know that you have been reluctant to think about it in the past, but that clearly is an option. So you have a minimum of two FDA-approved options that you have not tried yet. So knowing that, um, from my perspective, like I\u2019m going to be a little less sort of heroic and like waiting to see if this is going to work or not. Because it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve run out of options, and this is the last thing we\u2019re going to try anyway. You know?  There are other options out there. Because we do have those options, yes, one of them is a chemo. Um, we also don\u2019t want this cancer to advance too quickly that we miss the window and you get too sick and too frail, you know, to be able to tolerate those other therapies.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that, that is also in the back of my mind. And, because, because then I feel like we might have actually harmed you by missing the opportunity to give, you know, an FDA-approved therapy. Of course, that would be through K___ because that would be standard therapy. Um, so that\u2019s what the other part of my thinking.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay. And, and from my perspective, I didn\u2019t believe that this was going to be easy from the, from the beginning. I remember when I came, I came to J___ H___ for a reason. I came here for a consultation because I wasn\u2019t comfortable, uh, with the options that I believe K___ was offering. I came initially for that reason. It\u2019s strange that it was my dentist, so we talk about a lot. It\u2019s strange how you get into certain things, uh, by having relationships with people who have gone through it. My dentist had, uh, numerous family members, had dealt with cancer, and he had recommended, he said, you know what, D___, this is what you need to do. You need to go to one of the teaching hospitals either here in DC you can go to J___ H___, in B___, and from my perspective, there are enough individuals that have come to J___ H___, that are close friends of mine.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: That said, they shared with me that, uh, if you have a choice, go to J___ H___.
