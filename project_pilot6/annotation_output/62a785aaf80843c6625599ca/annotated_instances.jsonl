That, you got radiation for back in 2007 because usually, when prostate cancer recurs, it first recurs near the prostate. Am I making sense so far?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. Then if it progresses, if you do nothing, you get metastatic disease. And that's when we can see the cancer somewhere in your body either on the CAT scan or the bone scan. So that's a CT or CAT scan or the bone scan because prostate cancer goes to the bone. So when you came to me you already had surgery for localized disease, you had already had radiation, which we sometimes use for our chemical occurrence-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm. DOC- but you still had a rising PSA and we weren't sure if you were in this biochemical recurrence bucket or in this metastatic disease bucket. Okay. So, your imaging findings, so your CAT scan here shows\u2026so here are the, this is the summary. I\u2019ll just write summary. We can go through this. So, what this report shows- this is a CAT scan that shows coronary artery calcification, that means there's calcium build up in your around your heart. It's not uncommon for someone your age. Small atrial hernia not important. A thyroid nodule not that important. At some point, we can do a thyroid ultrasound, but we don't need to do anything about that right this moment. So this is what- is is maybe means that it's prostate cancer a small enhancing nodule in the left prostatectomy bed, which may reflect recurrence. So when you look in the full report, what they say is that there is a it's less than once every here is 0.7 by 0.9 centimeters, so then that's like less than one centimeter. So when it's that small, it's like, really difficult. It's actually like impossible to characterize it to say like, yes, this is definitively cancer or this is not cancer.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that's why it says maybe, but they don't- notably, they don't see any anywhere else, okay.

Okay so these are your two summaries.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So this is CT scan and this is bone scan. Okay. So those are you for your information. So with, with that you really fit into the bucket of what we consider biochemical recurrence.</span> <span class=\"greenText\"><b>Family Member</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay, which is good. Now the question becomes what do we do with you cuz you're in this bucket, biochemical recurrence. So you have a PSA that's rising the cancer somewhere, it seems to be growing, albeit maybe not that fast and before it gets to somewhere to metastatic what do we, what do we do? Okay, so the options for treatment at this point, are 1- observation- and observation what that entails is just monitoring your PSA and periodically doing CAT scans and bone scans and waiting to see if when you develop metastatic disease.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 45s "}}

We do have one other trial, uh, that involves, uh, a combination of two things. Uh, one is called, radium. And radium is a radioactive element that looks like calcium.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And the idea is we can trick the cancer, because prostate cancer is making, stimulating the bone to make new bone. (Sound Door opens)</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So we give this radium that looks like calcium, so he gets put in there also, and can give radiation kind of focally. So where there\u2019s spots on the bone, it gives radiation, but it doesn\u2019t radiate the liver or the lung.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right. Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So that drug, uh, would be another possible option, because it\u2019s a, it\u2019s an approved drug. I tend to use it in men who have more pain.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Have, you know, multiple bone spots.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But, right now, we\u2019re doing a trial where we\u2019re giving that drug in combination with a vaccine. The vaccine is called, sipuleucel-T. And that\u2019s the only vaccine we have for any cancer. Both drugs together have shown that they can improve, uh, how long men live with, from prostate cancer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_warm": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_info": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_support": "moderately", "pos_partnership": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}
