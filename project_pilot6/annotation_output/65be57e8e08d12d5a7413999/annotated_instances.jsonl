So unfortunately uh you wouldn\u2019t fit all those trials because of the prior treatments we have.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: And then we also have some chemotherapy trials which we potentially could consider if we were ready to do chemotherapy. Um, the um, trial, the trial in the cracks that we have, one is an immune therapy trial. Uh so right now when we get immune therapy, the reason that we use it for a lot of cancers, they haven\u2019t worked so well by itself for prostate cancer.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um hum.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So one thing we can look at is what if we give two immune therapies versus one. In an earlier study we did we saw more men that it worked in more men. So now we\u2019re doing a bigger study. The down side of that is when we give two immune therapies the toxicity is much worse. So about half of the men I, I would estimate headed to the hospital with toxicity.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Oh, really?</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: The main toxicity is really bad diarrhea. Because what these immune therapies are doing is sort of tipping the balance a little bit, trying to get the immune system to start seeing the cancer as foreign.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_agency": "moderately", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_competence": "moderately", "pos_support": "slightly", "pos_info": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}

Okay.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, I just wanted to s-stop there at the moment and I want to give you this piece of paper so you can look at it.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Um and do you have any questions about any of that because I know it can be quite complicated and uh information.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Exactly. The the good thing about this trial I did not mention, I think I should, um there\u2019s no placebo involved. So there are some studies where they give people um a sugar pill or basically inactive medication. This trial does not involve a placebo. And also in this trial, in both groups, both of you get the Xtandi by itself or the Xtandi plus the new experimental drug active therapy.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So there there isn\u2019t a but you\u2019re not getting any therapy or you\u2019re getting only a pla-placebo potentially. So, in response to what you just said which is you you wanna get some drug back into your system-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yup.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: That the clinical trial will give you the option of doing that um potentially with something experimental out and on-</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mhm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But not necessarily. Um just a couple of words about the side effects and they\u2019re all listed in this consent form which is fourteen pages long, so it\u2019s quite detailed. But um the main side effects are listed in section four and I will read that with you so you can look at it.
