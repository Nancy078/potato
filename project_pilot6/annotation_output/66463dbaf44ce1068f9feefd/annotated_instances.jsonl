And that\u2019s why we put you on this uh medication that at least you\u2019ve tolerated amazingly well. I mean you really haven\u2019t had any side effects, haven\u2019t felt any different, managed to keep up with everything you want to do. So that\u2019s been remarkable.

And honestly for how well you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what I\u2019m tempted to do. Okay.

The testing to see if you have the hereditary risk of cancer was negative.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Alright, so of these options, what I think is reasonable, and what I think is not reasonable. Observation for you actually, I don't think is reasonable. You're a pretty healthy guy. You're a pretty healthy guy. And you don't have any comorbidities. You know, I would expect you to live if you didn't have prostate cancer, I would expect to live for at least another 10 years. So I think that we should do something more than observation, right?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Yeah.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Okay. So this one would not be my first choice. Intermittent hormone therapy, I think if you wanted to go for a standard approach, like what everybody else is doing, I think that that is a very reasonable option. The downside is that you would be exposed to hormone therapy. And when we get to, if you ever get to this phase where you have metastatic disease where we can see your lymph nodes or see disease in the bones, you get started on hormonal hormone therapy anyways. So what usually happens in this approach is that you're getting it every six months. And, you know, maybe you get it for six months and you\u2019re off of it for two years, maybe three years together for six months or a year, go for six months necessarily. This is certainly not a bad option. This is the standard option. This is what we consider the standard of care, like what's most widely accepted. And this could be an option now or later. You know, having talked to you before. I think what we should maybe try and do first is see if you'd be eligible and if you have this genotype for the MAP study.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_info": "extremely", "pos_communicator": "not at all", "pos_agency": "not at all", "pos_support": "moderately"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 27s "}}
