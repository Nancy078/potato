The PSA last couple of times as we discussed last time has been going up. Okay. One of my concerns is if it keeps going up but the scans don\u2019t change, do we stay the same course? And honestly for how well you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what I\u2019m tempted to do. Okay. If however your bone scan shows me new areas or things growing then we are going to stop this treatment and go to something else.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: I see.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Now as we sort of discussed a little bit, the something else could either be going back and doing chemotherapy with Dr. K____ okay that\u2019s a potential option. And, or if we want to give it one more try with doing a different kind of hormonal therapy, we have a new hormone therapy agent that we are testing here you know that\u2019s been through multiple people who have had it and there\u2019s been some promising results initially so I think that would be another option.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Mm Hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: But you know so those are probably the potential choices. The third possible choice and that would depend on your CAT scans had some lymph nodes though that were seen so there is a study with a combination of two different therapies. Okay? One is the Xofigo which is a radiation treatment that\u2019s approved. You\u2019ve probably heard of it I know.</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_respect": "moderately", "pos_communicator": "slightly", "pos_agency": "slightly", "pos_empathetic": "moderately", "pos_warm": "slightly", "pos_partnership": "not at all", "pos_competence": "slightly", "pos_support": "slightly", "pos_info": "slightly"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 25s "}}
