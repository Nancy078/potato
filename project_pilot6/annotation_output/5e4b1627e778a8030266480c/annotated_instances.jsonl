Huh, so far we know that giving high doses of vitamin C is safe.  Huh, we haven\u2019t seen many real extra side effects.  But we don\u2019t know the end of the answer.

You\u2019re not sixty-five.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Right.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Huh, so we\u2019d have to check with your insurance.

So definitely the dummy vitamin C or the real vitamin C we pay for because that\u2019s experimental.  Your insurance company may have to pay for the time in the chair to get the medicine.  Okay?
