Yeah.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Um</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Not ah truly applicable to you at this point. That\u2019s great for if you were just newly diagnosed with your prostate cancer or if you have some specific area on your spine. You obviously just got the radiation to there but if you know you\u2019re a baby, for example, and you had a really tiny spinal cord, and you have this cancer next to it, a proton would be the perfect treatment. For adults, it\u2019s a little harder to know what is better than the standard. So you know you hope maybe if you got protons you wouldn\u2019t have had so many side effects. That\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s not as mainstream I think as we\u2019d like to see it. At some point now when they\u2019re really up and running and more patients will get experience, we\u2019ll probably get a better sense of that.

The radiation you got is still image guided. It\u2019s still blocked off. So those studies are ongoing. And that\u2019s why not every center and not every state has protons.

And you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better. So this issue comes around a lot because of prostate. So protons wanted to replace, you know, oh, and I going to save the bladder or anything else. And that data doesn\u2019t show it to be better necessarily. So it\u2019s a big fight between the radiation guys. They\u2019re trying to figure that out themselves. Um, but I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s good technology. So I think if needed, if it was a really tough spot or really small area I think it\u2019s reasonable.

Like the night before I didn\u2019t wake up until like four and then some nights it might be every two hours or couple of hours.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: hm mmm, yep, yeah, Do you feel like you empty when you pee</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: or do you feel there\u2019s a little more in there?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: There\u2019s more because you go ahead and pee the full stream then you stop then you, it\u2019s bogged down.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: Yep, Yep, So, do me a favor. Like after seven p.m. at night don\u2019t drink fluid;</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: don\u2019t drink water, don\u2019t drink tea, don\u2019t drink coffee, don\u2019t drink juice, don\u2019t drink milk, don\u2019t drink anything. After dinner, just done. One, that will allow you to sleep because I think your prostate is acting up, it\u2019s too big which means it\u2019s blocking the way of the pee and then what happens is you pee but there\u2019s stuff left over but your body doesn\u2019t know it until just a little bit more accumulates in there and also your bladder is like oh, I was this full and now I\u2019m this full, okay, I got to pee again and when you\u2019re laying down you pee a lot easier because then your whole body is trying to recalibrate and what\u2019s happening. So, at that point you got to pee some more. So, if you give it less reason to pee which means you don\u2019t have enough fluid on board then you won\u2019t pee because there\u2019s not fluid to put through. Okay?</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Okay.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: So, you do me a favor and do that. I\u2019ll work on getting your CAT scan and your bone scan set up and then we\u2019ll figure out the next step. My thinking is that it probably - I\u2019m going to shoot for the ah vaccine because once that\u2019s done we don\u2019t go back to it and then we just sort of put that and say done and then we move on to the other stuff. What do you think of that? Because if that sounds okay what takes forever is insurance</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: mm hmm.</span> <span class=\"redText\"><b>Doctor</b>: so if you\u2019re kind of conceptually okay with that then I\u2019m going to have J____, you know J____ who is our nurse, if you don\u2019t know J____, you\u2019re gonna know J____ in a minute.</span> <span class=\"blueText\"><b>Patient</b>: Is that the one that took the\u2026</span>", "label_annotations": {"select_appropriateness": {"pos_info": "very", "pos_warm": "very", "pos_support": "very", "pos_partnership": "very", "pos_competence": "very", "pos_agency": "very", "pos_communicator": "very", "pos_respect": "very", "pos_empathetic": "very"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 22s "}}
